      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\n",

      "whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\n",
      "Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\n",
      "quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\n",
      "teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\n",
      "intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\n",
      "were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\n",
      "round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\n",
      "hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\n",
      "being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\n",
      "to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\n",
      "berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\n",
      "as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:\n",
      "a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\n",
      "such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\n",
      "Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\n",
      "fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household\n",
      "should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\n",
      "the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\n",
      "stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\n",
      "the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n",

      "weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\n",
      "would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\n",
      "gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\n",
      "stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\n",

      "At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\n",

      "with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\n",
      "once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\n",
      "rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\n",
      "business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\n",
      "there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\n",
      "houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\n",
      "dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\n",
      "being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\n",
      "who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\n",

      "Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\n",

      "that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\n",

      "undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\n",
      "Marley's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\n",
      "in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\n",
      "a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\n",
      "Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\n",
      "forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\n",
      "and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\n",
      "That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\n",
      "be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\n",
      "its own expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n",
      "\n",
      "To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\n",
      "a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\n",
      "be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\n",
      "it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n",
      "\n",

      "and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\n",
      "be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the\n",
      "hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\n",
      "and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed\n",

      "\n",
      "The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\n",
      "and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a\n",
      "separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\n",
      "frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\n",
      "and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\n",

      "you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\n",
      "with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\n",
      "balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\n",
      "room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\n",
      "locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\n",

      "the face to desire to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\n",

      "\n",
      "Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\n",
      "locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\n",

      "and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\n",
      "obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract\n",
      "the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace\n",
      "was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all\n",
      "round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\n",
      "There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,\n",
      "Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like\n",
      "feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in\n",
      "butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that\n",
      "face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,\n",
      "and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at\n",
      "first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the\n",
      "disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of\n",
      "old Marley's head on every one.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Humbug!' said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several turns he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the\n",
      "chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that\n",
      "hung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with\n",
      "a chamber in the highest storey of the building. It was with great\n",
      "astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that, as he\n",
      "looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the\n",
      "outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and\n",
      "so did every bell in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an\n",
      "hour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together. They were succeeded\n",
      "by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a\n",
      "heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then\n",
      "remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\n",
      "dragging chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the\n",
      "noise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then\n",
      "coming straight towards his door.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's humbug still!' said Scrooge. 'I won't believe it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through\n",
      "the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming\n",
      "in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, 'I know him! Marley's\n",
      "Ghost!' and fell again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\n",
      "tights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his\n",
      "pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he\n",
      "drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like\n",
      "a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,\n",
      "keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His\n",
      "body was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking\n",
      "through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\n",
      "never believed it until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through\n",
      "and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\n",
      "influence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the\n",
      "folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not\n",
      "observed before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his\n",
      "senses.\n",

      "transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt\n",
      "that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the\n",
      "necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the\n",
      "opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Because,' said Scrooge, 'a little thing affects them. A slight disorder\n",
      "of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,\n",
      "a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.\n",
      "There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in\n",
      "his heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\n",
      "smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his\n",
      "terror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,\n",
      "would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something\n",
      "very awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\n",
      "atmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was\n",
      "clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its\n",
      "hair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour\n",
      "from an oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You see this toothpick?' said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,\n",
      "for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a\n",
      "second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Well!' returned Scrooge, 'I have but to swallow this, and be for the\n",
      "rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own\n",
      "creation. Humbug, I tell you: humbug!'\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such\n",
      "a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,\n",
      "to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his\n",
      "horror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it\n",
      "were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its\n",
      "breast!\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mercy!' he said. 'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Man of the worldly mind!' replied the Ghost, 'do you believe in me or\n",
      "not?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I do,' said Scrooge; 'I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and\n",
      "why do they come to me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is required of every man,' the Ghost returned, 'that the spirit\n",
      "within him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and\n",
      "wide; and, if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do\n",
      "so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is\n",
      "me!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,\n",
      "and turned to happiness!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its\n",
      "shadowy hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are fettered,' said Scrooge, trembling. 'Tell me why?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wear the chain I forged in life,' replied the Ghost. 'I made it link\n",
      "by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of\n",
      "my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge trembled more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Or would you know,' pursued the Ghost, 'the weight and length of the\n",
      "strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this\n",
      "seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a\n",
      "ponderous chain!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding\n",
      "himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he\n",
      "could see nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Jacob!' he said imploringly. 'Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak\n",

      "'I have none to give,' the Ghost replied. 'It comes from other regions,\n",

      "men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all\n",
      "permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Your welfare!' said the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that\n",
      "a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Rise! and walk with me!'\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the\n",
      "hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the\n",
      "thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in\n",
      "his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon\n",
      "him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not\n",
      "to be resisted. He rose; but, finding that the Spirit made towards the\n",
      "window, clasped its robe in supplication.\n",

      "\n",
      "As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon\n",
      "an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely\n",
      "vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist\n",
      "had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow\n",
      "upon the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Heaven!' said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked\n",
      "about him. 'I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been\n",
      "light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense\n",
      "of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air,\n",
      "each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and\n",
      "cares long, long forgotten!\n",

      "and tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its\n",
      "bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen\n",
      "trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other\n",
      "boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were\n",
      "in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were\n",
      "so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'These are but shadows of the things that have been,' said the Ghost.\n",

      "them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why\n",
      "did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why\n",
      "was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\n",
      "Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several\n",

      "\n",
      "Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a\n",
      "mansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola\n",
      "on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of\n",
      "broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\n",
      "were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\n",
      "Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and\n",
      "sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\n",
      "state within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\n",
      "open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\n",
      "vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the\n",
      "place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\n",
      "candle light and not too much to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back\n",
      "of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\n",
      "melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\n",
      "desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and\n",
      "Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as\n",
      "he had used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\n",
      "behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed waterspout in the\n",
      "dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent\n",
      "poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a\n",
      "clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening\n",
      "influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\n",
      "intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully\n",
      "real and distinct to look at, stood outside the window, with an axe\n",
      "stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, it's Ali Baba!' Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. 'It's dear old\n",
      "honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time, when yonder\n",
      "solitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first\n",
      "time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his\n",

      "down in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him?\n",
      "And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon\n",
      "his head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had he to be\n",
      "married to the Princess?'\n",
      "\n",
      "To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\n",
      "subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and\n",
      "to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to\n",
      "his business friends in the City, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge. 'Green body and yellow tail, with a\n",
      "thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!\n",
      "Poor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing\n",
      "round the island. \"Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\n",
      "Crusoe?\" The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the\n",

      "\n",
      "Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,\n",
      "he said, in pity for his former self, 'Poor boy!' and cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish,' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking\n",
      "about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff; 'but it's too late now.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is the matter?' asked the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nothing,' said Scrooge. 'Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas\n",
      "carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:\n",
      "that's all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\n",
      "'Let us see another Christmas!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\n",
      "little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\n",
      "fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\n",
      "shown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\n",
      "than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\n",
      "happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\n",
      "gone home for the jolly holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\n",
      "looked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\n",
      "anxiously towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\n",
      "in, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\n",
      "addressed him as her 'dear, dear brother.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping\n",
      "her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. 'To bring you home, home,\n",
      "home!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Home, little Fan?' returned the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes!' said the child, brimful of glee. 'Home for good and all. Home for\n",
      "ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's\n",
      "like heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to\n",
      "bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;\n",
      "and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And\n",

      "being too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then\n",
      "she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and\n",
      "he, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\n",

      "dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\n",
      "and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\n",
      "that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\n",
      "terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\n",
      "a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\n",

      "older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\n",
      "rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care\n",
      "and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\n",
      "which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\n",
      "the growing tree would fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning\n",

      "\n",
      "Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\n",
      "bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\n",
      "that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\n",
      "restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\n",
      "purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\n",
      "him through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\n",
      "uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\n",
      "new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\n",
      "hands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\n",
      "bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\n",
      "appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\n",
      "acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\n",
      "day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\n",
      "that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\n",
      "between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\n",
      "and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\n",
      "as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\n",
      "ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\n",
      "between a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\n",
      "prepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\n",
      "shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\n",
      "minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\n",
      "All this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\n",
      "of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\n",
      "hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\n",
      "ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\n",
      "and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\n",
      "interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\n",
      "consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\n",
      "or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\n",
      "predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\n",
      "unquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\n",
      "the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\n",
      "room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\n",
      "taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\n",
      "his slippers to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\n",
      "his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\n",
      "a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\n",
      "living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\n",
      "bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\n",
      "and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\n",
      "scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\n",
      "that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\n",
      "or Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\n",
      "floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\n",
      "brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\n",
      "mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\n",
      "cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\n",
      "twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\n",
      "with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\n",
      "jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\n",
      "unlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\n",
      "Scrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\n",

      "Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\n",
      "or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\n",
      "figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\n",
      "warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\n",
      "ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\n",
      "other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\n",
      "icicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\n",
      "face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\n",
      "unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\n",
      "an antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\n",
      "eaten up with rust.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n",

      "where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk\n",
      "and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement\n",
      "in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence\n",

      "the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed\n",
      "up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons: furrows\n",
      "that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great\n",

      "blazing away to their dear heart's content. There was nothing very\n",
      "cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\n",

      "first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\n",
      "guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\n",
      "fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\n",
      "neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\n",
      "enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\n",
      "friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\n",
      "give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\n",
      "company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\n",
      "the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\n",
      "capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\n",
      "bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\n",
      "lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\n",
      "light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\n",
      "loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\n",
      "he had any company but Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\n",
      "bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\n",
      "about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\n",
      "itself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\n",
      "that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\n",
      "rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\n",
      "red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\n",
      "and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\n",
      "darkest night.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\n",
      "returned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n",
      "\n",
      "A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\n",
      "towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\n",
      "cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\n",
      "woman, with their children and their children's children, and another\n",
      "generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\n",
      "The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\n",
      "upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\n",
      "very old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\n",
      "in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\n",
      "quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\n",
      "passing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\n",
      "Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\n",
      "range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\n",
      "thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\n",
      "dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\n",
      "on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\n",
      "stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\n",
      "and storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\n",
      "water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\n",
      "through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\n",
      "brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\n",
      "table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\n",
      "can of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\n",
      "and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\n",
      "be--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\n",
      "being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\n",
      "ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\n",
      "bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\n",
      "several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\n",
      "had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\n",
      "some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\n",
      "every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\n",
      "word for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\n",
      "shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\n",
      "cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of\n",
      "the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the\n",
      "lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as\n",
      "profound as death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus\n",
      "engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to\n",
      "Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a\n",
      "bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his\n",
      "side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ha, ha!' laughed Scrooge's nephew. 'Ha, ha, ha!'\n",
      "\n",
      "If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blessed\n",
      "in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to\n",
      "know him too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there\n",
      "is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so\n",
      "irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew laughed in this way--holding his sides, rolling his head, and\n",
      "twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions--Scrooge's\n",
      "niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled\n",
      "friends, being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!' cried Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew. 'He believed it, too!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'More shame for him, Fred!' said Scrooge's niece indignantly. Bless\n",
      "those women! they never do anything by halves. They are always in\n",
      "earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was very pretty; exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,\n",
      "surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made\n",
      "to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about\n",
      "her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the\n",
      "sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head.\n",
      "Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but\n",
      "satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory!\n",
      "\n",
      "'He's a comical old fellow,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that's the truth;\n",
      "and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their\n",
      "own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,' hinted Scrooge's niece. 'At least, you\n",
      "always tell _me_ so.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What of that, my dear?' said Scrooge's nephew. 'His wealth is of no use\n",
      "to him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself comfortable\n",
      "with it. He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is\n",
      "ever going to benefit Us with it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I have no patience with him,' observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's\n",
      "niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, I have!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'I am sorry for him; I couldn't be\n",
      "angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself always.\n",
      "Here he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine\n",
      "with us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,' interrupted Scrooge's\n",
      "niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have\n",
      "been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and with the\n",
      "dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well! I am very glad to hear it,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'because I\n",
      "haven't any great faith in these young housekeepers. What do _you_ say,\n",
      "Topper?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters,\n",
      "for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right\n",
      "to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge's niece's\n",
      "sister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the\n",
      "roses--blushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do go on, Fred,' said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands. 'He never\n",
      "finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to\n",
      "keep the infection off, though the plump sister tried hard to do it with\n",
      "aromatic vinegar, his example was unanimously followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I was only going to say,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that the consequence\n",
      "of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I\n",
      "think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.\n",
      "I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own\n",
      "thoughts, either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers. I mean\n",
      "to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for\n",
      "I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help\n",
      "thinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good\n",
      "temper, year after year, and saying, \"Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\" If it\n",
      "only put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_\n",
      "something; and I think I shook him yesterday.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\n",
      "But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed\n",
      "at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their\n",
      "merriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.\n",
      "\n",
      "After tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew\n",
      "what they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:\n",
      "especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and\n",
      "never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over\n",
      "it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played, among other\n",
      "tunes, a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle\n",
      "it in two minutes) which had been familiar to the child who fetched\n",
      "Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost\n",
      "of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things\n",
      "that Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more;\n",
      "and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he\n",
      "might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with\n",
      "his own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\n",
      "Marley.\n",

      "tucker!_]\n",
      "\n",
      "But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a while they\n",
      "played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never\n",
      "better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.\n",
      "Stop! There was first a game at blind man's-buff. Of course there was.\n",
      "And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes\n",
      "in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and\n",
      "Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The\n",
      "way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on\n",
      "the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling\n",
      "over the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself\n",
      "amongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew\n",
      "where the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had\n",
      "fallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have\n",
      "made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an\n",
      "affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in\n",
      "the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't\n",
      "fair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in\n",
      "spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,\n",
      "he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct\n",
      "was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his\n",
      "pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to\n",
      "assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her\n",
      "finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No\n",
      "doubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in\n",
      "office, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind man's-buff party, but was made\n",
      "comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where\n",
      "the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the\n",
      "forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the\n",
      "alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very\n",
      "great, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters\n",
      "hollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\n",
      "There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all\n",
      "played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he\n",
      "had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he\n",
      "sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed\n",
      "right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to\n",
      "cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge, blunt as he took it in\n",
      "his head to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon\n",
      "him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay\n",
      "until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Here is a new game,' said Scrooge. 'One half-hour, Spirit, only one!'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of\n",
      "something, and the rest must find out what, he only answering to their\n",
      "questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to\n",
      "which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an\n",
      "animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\n",
      "animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes and\n",
      "lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show\n",
      "of, and wasn't led by anybody, and didn't live in a menagerie, and was\n",

      "bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every\n",
      "fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar\n",
      "of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to\n",
      "get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a\n",
      "similar state, cried out:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though\n",
      "some objected that the reply to 'Is it a bear?' ought to have been\n",
      "'Yes'; inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have\n",

      "nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that\n",
      "he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked\n",
      "them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the\n",
      "whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\n",
      "nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but\n",
      "always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick-beds, and they\n",
      "were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by\n",
      "struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty,\n",
      "and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and gaol, in misery's every\n",
      "refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast\n",
      "the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing and taught\n",
      "Scrooge his precepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts\n",
      "of this, because the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into\n",
      "the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that, while\n",
      "Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older,\n",
      "clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it\n",
      "until they left a children's Twelfth-Night party, when, looking at the\n",
      "Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair\n",
      "was grey.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are spirits' lives so short?' asked Scrooge.\n",

      "intently at the Spirit's robe, 'but I see something strange, and not\n",

      "claw?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\n",
      "sorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n",
      "\n",
      "From the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\n",
      "frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\n",
      "upon the outside of its garment.\n",
      "\n",
      "'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\n",
      "prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\n",
      "filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\n",
      "stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\n",
      "them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\n",
      "enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\n",
      "degradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\n",
      "mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\n",
      "dread.\n",

      "rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n",
      "\n",

      "girl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\n",
      "all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\n",
      "unless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\n",

      "from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\n",
      "surrounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\n",

      "paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\n",
      "recover.\n",

      "word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was\n",
      "a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone. What _they_ wanted in\n",
      "the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge\n",
      "did not dare to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Spirit!' he said, 'this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not\n",
      "leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I understand you,' Scrooge returned, 'and I would do it if I could. But\n",
      "I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;\n",
      "and, withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her\n",
      "children were.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked\n",
      "up and down the room, started at every sound, looked out from the\n",
      "window, glanced at the clock, tried, but in vain, to work with her\n",
      "needle, and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door,\n",
      "and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though\n",
      "he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now, a kind of\n",
      "serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to\n",
      "repress.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,\n",
      "and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a\n",
      "long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is it good,' she said, 'or bad?' to help him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Bad,' he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We are quite ruined?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No. There is hope yet, Caroline.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If _he_ relents,' she said, amazed, 'there is! Nothing is past hope, if\n",
      "such a miracle has happened.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He is past relenting,' said her husband. 'He is dead.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth; but she\n",
      "was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so with clasped hands.\n",
      "She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was\n",
      "the emotion of her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What the half-drunken woman, whom I told you of last night, said to me\n",
      "when I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay--and what I thought\n",
      "was a mere excuse to avoid me--turns out to have been quite true. He was\n",
      "not only very ill, but dying, then.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To whom will our debt be transferred?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know. But, before that time, we shall be ready with the money;\n",
      "and even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so\n",
      "merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light\n",
      "hearts, Caroline!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's\n",
      "faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little\n",
      "understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's\n",
      "death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the\n",
      "event, was one of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,' said Scrooge; 'or\n",
      "that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever\n",
      "present to me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet;\n",
      "and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,\n",
      "but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house;\n",
      "the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the\n",
      "children seated round the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues\n",
      "in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.\n",
      "The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they\n",
      "were very quiet!\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy\n",
      "must have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why\n",
      "did he not go on?\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The colour hurts my eyes,' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n",
      "\n",
      "'They're better now again,' said Cratchit's wife. 'It makes them weak by\n",
      "candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes\n",
      "home for the world. It must be near his time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Past it rather,' Peter answered, shutting up his book. 'But I think he\n",
      "has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings,\n",
      "mother.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful\n",
      "voice, that only faltered once:\n",
      "\n",
      "'I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon\n",
      "his shoulder very fast indeed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And so have I,' cried Peter. 'Often.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And so have I,' exclaimed another. So had all.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But he was very light to carry,' she resumed, intent upon her work,\n",
      "'and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble, no trouble. And\n",
      "there is your father at the door!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter--he had\n",
      "need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob,\n",
      "and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young\n",
      "Cratchits got upon his knees, and laid, each child, a little cheek\n",
      "against his face, as if they said, 'Don't mind it, father. Don't be\n",
      "grieved!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.\n",
      "He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed\n",
      "of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday,\n",
      "he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?' said his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, my dear,' returned Bob. 'I wish you could have gone. It would have\n",
      "done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I\n",
      "promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little\n",
      "child!' cried Bob. 'My little child!'\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped\n",
      "it, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they\n",
      "were.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left the room, and went upstairs into the room above, which was\n",
      "lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close\n",
      "beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there\n",
      "lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and\n",
      "composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\n",
      "had happened, and went down again quite happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "They drew about the fire, and talked, the girls and mother working\n",
      "still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the\n",
      "street that day, and seeing that he looked a little--'just a little\n",
      "down, you know,' said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him.\n",
      "'On which,' said Bob, 'for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you\n",
      "ever heard, I told him. \"I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,\" he\n",
      "said, \"and heartily sorry for your good wife.\" By-the-bye, how he ever\n",
      "knew _that_ I don't know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Knew what, my dear?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, that you were a good wife,' replied Bob.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Everybody knows that,' said Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very well observed, my boy!' cried Bob. 'I hope they do. \"Heartily\n",
      "sorry,\" he said, \"for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in\n",
      "any way,\" he said, giving me his card, \"that's where I live. Pray come\n",
      "to me.\" Now, it wasn't,' cried Bob, 'for the sake of anything he might\n",
      "be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite\n",
      "delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt\n",
      "with us.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm sure he's a good soul!' said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You would be sure of it, my dear,' returned Bob, 'if you saw and spoke\n",
      "to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--mark what I say!--if he got\n",
      "Peter a better situation.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only hear that, Peter,' said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And then,' cried one of the girls, 'Peter will be keeping company with\n",
      "some one, and setting up for himself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Get along with you!' retorted Peter, grinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's just as likely as not,' said Bob, 'one of these days; though\n",
      "there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But, however and whenever we\n",
      "part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny\n",
      "Tim--shall we--or this first parting that there was among us?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Never, father!' cried they all.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And I know,' said Bob, 'I know, my dears, that when we recollect how\n",
      "patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we\n",
      "shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in\n",
      "doing it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, never, father!' they all cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am very happy,' said little Bob, 'I am very happy!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young\n",
      "Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny\n",
      "Tim, thy childish essence was from God!\n",
      "\n",
      "'Spectre,' said Scrooge, 'something informs me that our parting moment\n",
      "is at hand. I know it but I know not how. Tell me what man that was whom\n",
      "we saw lying dead?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come conveyed him, as before--though at a\n",
      "different time, he thought: indeed there seemed no order in these latter\n",
      "visions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of business\n",
      "men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for\n",
      "anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until\n",
      "besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "'This court,' said Scrooge, 'through which we hurry now, is where my\n",
      "place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the\n",
      "house. Let me behold what I shall be in days to come.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The house is yonder,' Scrooge exclaimed. 'Why do you point away?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The inexorable finger underwent no change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an\n",
      "office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the\n",
      "figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He joined it once again, and, wondering why and whither he had gone,\n",
      "accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round\n",
      "before entering.\n",
      "\n",
      "A churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man, whose name he had now to\n",
      "learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by\n",
      "houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's death,\n",
      "not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A\n",
      "worthy place!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced\n",
      "towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he\n",
      "dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,' said Scrooge,\n",
      "'answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will\n",
      "be, or are they shadows of the things that May be only?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in,\n",
      "they must lead,' said Scrooge. 'But if the courses be departed from, the\n",
      "ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit was immovable as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and, following the\n",
      "finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name,\n",
      "EBENEZER SCROOGE.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Am I that man who lay upon the bed?' he cried upon his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, Spirit! Oh no, no!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger still was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Spirit!' he cried, tight clutching at its robe, 'hear me! I am not the\n",
      "man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this\n",
      "intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?'\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time the hand appeared to shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Spirit,' he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it,\n",
      "'your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may\n",
      "change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind hand trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I\n",
      "will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all\n",
      "Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they\n",
      "teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!'\n",
      "\n",
      "In his agony he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but\n",
      "he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit stronger yet,\n",
      "repulsed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw\n",
      "an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and\n",

      "'I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's,' whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands,\n",
      "and splitting with a laugh. 'He shan't know who sends it. It's twice the\n",

      "\n",
      "The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one; but write\n",
      "it he did, somehow, and went downstairs to open the street-door, ready\n",
      "for the coming of the poulterer's man. As he stood there, waiting his\n",
      "arrival, the knocker caught his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I shall love it as long as I live!' cried Scrooge, patting it with his\n",
      "hand. 'I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it\n",
      "has in its face! It's a wonderful knocker!--Here's the turkey. Hallo!\n",
      "Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!'\n",
      "\n",
      "It _was_ a turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird.\n",

      "sealing-wax.\n",
      "\n",

      "for the turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the\n",
      "chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by\n",
      "the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\n",
      "chuckled till he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much;\n",
      "and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are\n",
      "at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a\n",
      "piece of sticking-plaster over it, and been quite satisfied.\n",

      "He dressed himself 'all in his best,' and at last got out into the\n",
      "streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them\n",
      "with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and, walking with his hands behind\n",
      "him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so\n",
      "irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured\n",
      "fellows said, 'Good-morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!' And Scrooge\n",
      "said often afterwards that, of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard,\n",
      "those were the blithest in his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not gone far when, coming on towards him, he beheld the portly\n",
      "gentleman who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and\n",
      "said, 'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?' It sent a pang across his heart\n",
      "to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but\n",
      "he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My dear sir,' said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old\n",
      "gentleman by both his hands, 'how do you do? I hope you succeeded\n",
      "yesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mr. Scrooge?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Scrooge. 'That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant\n",
      "to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness----'\n",
      "Here Scrooge whispered in his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lord bless me!' cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away.\n",
      "'My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you please,' said Scrooge. 'Not a farthing less. A great many\n",
      "back-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that\n",
      "favour?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My dear sir,' said the other, shaking hands with him, 'I don't know\n",
      "what to say to such munifi----'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't say anything, please,' retorted Scrooge. 'Come and see me. Will\n",
      "you come and see me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I will!' cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thankee,' said Scrooge. 'I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty\n",
      "times. Bless you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people\n",
      "hurrying to and fro, and patted the children on the head, and questioned\n",
      "beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the\n",
      "windows; and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had\n",
      "never dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much\n",
      "happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's\n",
      "house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and\n",
