174,1,1,"The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light
summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through
the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate
perfume of the pink - flowering thorn."
174,1,2,"From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle - bags on which he was
lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry
Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey - sweet and honey - coloured
blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to
bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then
the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long
tussore - silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,
producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of
those pallid, jade - faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of
an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of
swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their
way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous
insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,
seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London
was like the bourdon note of a distant organ."
174,1,3,"In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the
full - length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,
and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist
himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago
caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many
strange conjectures."
174,1,4,"As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so
skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his
face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and
closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought
to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he
might awake."
174,1,5,"“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said
Lord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the
Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have
gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been
able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that
I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor
is really the only place.”"
174,1,6,"“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head
back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at
Oxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”"
174,1,7,"Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through
the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls
from his heavy, opium - tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear
fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You
do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,
you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is
only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is
not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above
all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if
old men are ever capable of any emotion.”"
174,1,8,"“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit
it. I have put too much of myself into it.”"
174,1,9,Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.
174,1,10,"“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”"
174,1,11,"“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you
were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with
your rugged strong face and your coal - black hair, and this young
Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose - leaves. Why,
my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you — well, of course you have an
intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends
where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode
of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one
sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something
horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.
How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But
then in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the
age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,
and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.
Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but
whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of
that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here
in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer
when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter
yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”"
174,1,12,"“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am
not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to
look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.
There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,
the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering
steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.
The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit
at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,
they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all
should live — undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They
neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.
Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are — my art,
whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks — we shall all suffer
for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”"
174,1,13,"“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the
studio towards Basil Hallward."
174,1,14,"“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”"
174,1,15,“But why not?”
174,1,16,"“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their
names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown
to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life
mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if
one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I
am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,
I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into
one’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”"
174,1,17,"“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem
to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it
makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I
never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.
When we meet — we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go
down to the Duke’s — we tell each other the most absurd stories with the
most serious faces. My wife is very good at it — much better, in fact,
than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But
when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish
she would; but she merely laughs at me.”"
174,1,18,"“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil
Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I
believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are
thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary
fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.
Your cynicism is simply a pose.”"
174,1,19,"“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”
cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the
garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that
stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the
polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous."
174,1,20,"After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be
going, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your
answering a question I put to you some time ago.”"
174,1,21,"“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground."
174,1,22,“You know quite well.”
174,1,23,"“I do not, Harry.”"
174,1,24,"“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you
won’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”"
174,1,25,“I told you the real reason.”
174,1,26,"“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of
yourself in it. Now, that is childish.”"
174,1,27,"“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every
portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not
of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is
not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on
the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit
this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of
my own soul.”"
174,1,28,Lord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.
174,1,29,"“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came
over his face."
174,1,30,"“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at
him."
174,1,31,"“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;
“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly
believe it.”"
174,1,32,"Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink - petalled daisy from
the grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he
replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white - feathered disk,
“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it
is quite incredible.”"
174,1,33,"The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy
lilac - blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the
languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a
blue thread a long thin dragon - fly floated past on its brown gauze
wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart
beating, and wondered what was coming."
174,1,34,"“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two
months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor
artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to
remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a
white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock - broker, can gain
a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room
about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious
academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at
me. I turned half - way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.
When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation
of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some
one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to
do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art
itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know
yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my
own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.
Then — but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to
tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had
a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and
exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was
not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take
no credit to myself for trying to escape.”"
174,1,35,"“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience
is the trade - name of the firm. That is all.”"
174,1,36,"“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.
However, whatever was my motive — and it may have been pride, for I used
to be very proud — I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I
stumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,
Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”"
174,1,37,"“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,
pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers."
174,1,38,"“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people
with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and
parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her
once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe
some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had
been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the
nineteenth - century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself
face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely
stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.
It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.
Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We
would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of
that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined
to know each other.”"
174,1,39,"“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his
companion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her
guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red - faced old
gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my
ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to
everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I
like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests
exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them
entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants
to know.”"
174,1,40,"“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward
listlessly."
174,1,41,"“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in
opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she
say about Mr. Dorian Gray?”"
174,1,42,"“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy — poor dear mother and I absolutely
inseparable. Quite forget what he does — afraid he — doesn’t do
anything — oh, yes, plays the piano — or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’
Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”"
174,1,43,"“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far
the best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy."
174,1,44,"Hallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,
Harry,” he murmured — “or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every
one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”"
174,1,45,"“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back
and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of
glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the
summer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference
between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my
acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good
intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I
have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual
power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of
me? I think it is rather vain.”"
174,1,46,"“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be
merely an acquaintance.”"
174,1,47,"“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”"
174,1,48,"“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”"
174,1,49,"“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,
and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”"
174,1,50,"“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning."
174,1,51,"“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my
relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand
other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize
with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices
of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and
immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of
us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When
poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite
magnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the
proletariat live correctly.”"
174,1,52,"“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is
more, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”"
174,1,53,"Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his
patent - leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are
Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one
puts forward an idea to a true Englishman — always a rash thing to do — he
never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The
only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it
oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with
the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities
are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual
will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his
wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to
discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons
better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better
than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.
How often do you see him?”"
174,1,54,"“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is
absolutely necessary to me.”"
174,1,55,"“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but
your art.”"
174,1,56,"“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes
think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the
world’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,
and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.
What the invention of oil - painting was to the Venetians, the face of
Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will
some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from
him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much
more to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am
dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such
that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,
and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good
work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way — I wonder
will you understand me? — his personality has suggested to me an entirely
new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things
differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a
way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of
thought’ — who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray
has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad — for he seems to
me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty — his merely
visible presence — ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?
Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school
that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the
perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and
body — how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and
have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.
Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that
landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but
which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever
done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray
sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the
first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had
always looked for and always missed.”"
174,1,57,"“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”"
174,1,58,"Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After
some time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply
a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.
He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.
He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the
curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain
colours. That is all.”"
174,1,59,“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.
174,1,60,"“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of
all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never
cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know
anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my
soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under
their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry — too
much of myself!”"
174,1,61,"“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion
is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”"
174,1,62,"“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create
beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We
live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of
autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I
will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall
never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”"
174,1,63,"“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only
the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very
fond of you?”"
174,1,64,"The painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered
after a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.
I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall
be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit
in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he
is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me
pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some
one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of
decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”"
174,1,65,"“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.
“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think
of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That
accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over - educate
ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have
something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and
facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly
well - informed man — that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the
thoroughly well - informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a
_bric - à - brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above
its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day
you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little
out of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You
will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that
he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be
perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will
alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art
one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is
that it leaves one so unromantic.”"
174,1,66,"“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of
Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change
too often.”"
174,1,67,"“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are
faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who
know love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty
silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self - conscious and
satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was
a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,
and the blue cloud - shadows chased themselves across the grass like
swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other
people’s emotions were! — much more delightful than their ideas, it
seemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends — those
were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent
amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long
with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure
to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have
been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model
lodging - houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those
virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.
The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown
eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped
all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He
turned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”"
174,1,68,"“Remembered what, Harry?”"
174,1,69,“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”
174,1,70,"“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown."
174,1,71,"“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told
me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her
in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state
that she never told me he was good - looking. Women have no appreciation
of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very
earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a
creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping
about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”"
174,1,72,"“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”"
174,1,73,“Why?”
174,1,74,“I don’t want you to meet him.”
174,1,75,“You don’t want me to meet him?”
174,1,76,“No.”
174,1,77,"“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into
the garden."
174,1,78,"“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing."
174,1,79,"The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.
“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man
bowed and went up the walk."
174,1,80,"Then he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he
said. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite
right in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence
him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many
marvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who
gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist
depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and
the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will."
174,1,81,"“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward
by the arm, he almost led him into the house."
174,2,1,"As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with
his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s
“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to
learn them. They are perfectly charming.”"
174,2,2,"“That entirely depends on how you sit to - day, Dorian.”"
174,2,3,"“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life - sized portrait of
myself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music - stool in a
wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint
blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your
pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”"
174,2,4,"“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I
have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you
have spoiled everything.”"
174,2,5,"“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord
Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often
spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am
afraid, one of her victims also.”"
174,2,6,"“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a
funny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel
with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to
have played a duet together — three duets, I believe. I don’t know what
she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”"
174,2,7,"“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.
And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The
audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to
the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”"
174,2,8,"“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,
laughing."
174,2,9,"Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,
with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp
gold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at
once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s
passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the
world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him."
174,2,10,"“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray — far too
charming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened
his cigarette - case."
174,2,11,"The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes
ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last
remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,
“Harry, I want to finish this picture to - day. Would you think it
awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”"
174,2,12,"Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he
asked."
174,2,13,"“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky
moods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell
me why I should not go in for philanthropy.”"
174,2,14,"“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a
subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly
shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don’t
really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your
sitters to have some one to chat to.”"
174,2,15,"Hallward bit his lip. “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.
Dorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”"
174,2,16,"Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. “You are very pressing, Basil,
but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the
Orleans. Good - bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon
Street. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when
you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”"
174,2,17,"“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,
too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is
horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask
him to stay. I insist upon it.”"
174,2,18,"“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,
gazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I
am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious
for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”"
174,2,19,“But what about my man at the Orleans?”
174,2,20,"The painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about
that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,
and don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry
says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single
exception of myself.”"
174,2,21,"Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek
martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom
he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a
delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few
moments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord
Henry? As bad as Basil says?”"
174,2,22,"“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is
immoral — immoral from the scientific point of view.”"
174,2,23,“Why?”
174,2,24,"“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does
not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His
virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as
sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an
actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is
self - development. To realize one’s nature perfectly — that is what each
of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have
forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s
self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe
the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone
out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,
which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of
religion — these are the two things that govern us. And yet — ”"
174,2,25,"“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good
boy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look
had come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before."
174,2,26,"“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with
that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of
him, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man
were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to
every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream — I
believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we
would forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the
Hellenic ideal — to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it
may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The
mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self - denial
that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse
that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body
sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of
purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,
or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is
to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for
the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its
monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that
the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the
brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place
also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose - red youth and your
rose - white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,
thoughts that have filled you with terror, day - dreams and sleeping
dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame — ”"
174,2,27,"“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what
to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.
Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”"
174,2,28,"For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and
eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh
influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come
really from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to
him — words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in
them — had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,
but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses."
174,2,29,"Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But
music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another
chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they
were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.
And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able
to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their
own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything
so real as words?"
174,2,30,"Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.
He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery - coloured to him. It
seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known
it?"
174,2,31,"With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise
psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.
He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,
and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book
which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he
wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.
He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How
fascinating the lad was!"
174,2,32,"Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had
the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes
only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence."
174,2,33,"“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go
out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”"
174,2,34,"“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of
anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And
I have caught the effect I wanted — the half - parted lips and the bright
look in the eyes. I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but
he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose
he has been paying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word that he
says.”"
174,2,35,"“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the
reason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”"
174,2,36,"“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his
dreamy languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is
horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,
something with strawberries in it.”"
174,2,37,"“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will
tell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I
will join you later on. Don’t keep Dorian too long. I have never been
in better form for painting than I am to - day. This is going to be my
masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.”"
174,2,38,"Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his
face in the great cool lilac - blossoms, feverishly drinking in their
perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand
upon his shoulder. “You are quite right to do that,” he murmured.
“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the
senses but the soul.”"
174,2,39,"The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had
tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There
was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are
suddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some
hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling."
174,2,40,"“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of
life — to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means
of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think
you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”"
174,2,41,"Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking
the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,
olive - coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was
something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His
cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,
as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.
But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been
left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil
Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered
him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to
have disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be
afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be
frightened."
174,2,42,"“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker has brought
out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be
quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must
not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.”"
174,2,43,"“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on
the seat at the end of the garden."
174,2,44,"“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”"
174,2,45,“Why?”
174,2,46,"“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing
worth having.”"
174,2,47,"“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”"
174,2,48,"“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and
ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion
branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will
feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it
always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.
Don’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius — is higher,
indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great
facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring - time, or the reflection in
dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be
questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of
those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t
smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That
may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,
beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not
judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not
the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But
what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in
which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your
beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there
are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those
mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than
defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something
dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your
roses. You will become sallow, and hollow - cheeked, and dull - eyed. You
will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.
Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying
to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the
ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the
false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!
Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.
Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism — that is what our century wants.
You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing
you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment
I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,
of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me
that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how
tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time
that your youth will last — such a little time. The common hill - flowers
wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next
June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the
clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold
its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy
that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses
rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the
passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite
temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!
There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”"
174,2,49,"Dorian Gray listened, open - eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell
from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for
a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe
of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in
trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make
us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we
cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays
sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the
bee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian
convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and
fro."
174,2,50,"Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made
staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and
smiled."
174,2,51,"“I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and
you can bring your drinks.”"
174,2,52,"They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green - and - white
butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear - tree at the corner of
the garden a thrush began to sing."
174,2,53,"“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at
him."
174,2,54,"“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”"
174,2,55,"“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.
Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to
make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only
difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice
lasts a little longer.”"
174,2,56,"As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s
arm. “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,
flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and
resumed his pose."
174,2,57,"Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm - chair and watched him.
The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that
broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back
to look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that
streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The
heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything."
174,2,58,"After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for
a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,
biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. “It is quite
finished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in
long vermilion letters on the left - hand corner of the canvas."
174,2,59,"Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a
wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well."
174,2,60,"“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said. “It is the
finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at
yourself.”"
174,2,61,"The lad started, as if awakened from some dream."
174,2,62,"“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform."
174,2,63,"“Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat splendidly
to - day. I am awfully obliged to you.”"
174,2,64,"“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry. “Isn’t it, Mr.
Gray?”"
174,2,65,"Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture
and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks
flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes,
as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there
motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to
him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own
beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.
Basil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the
charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed
at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had
come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his
terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and
now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full
reality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a
day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and
colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet
would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. The
life that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become
dreadful, hideous, and uncouth."
174,2,66,"As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a
knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes
deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt
as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart."
174,2,67,"“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the
lad’s silence, not understanding what it meant."
174,2,68,"“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry. “Who wouldn’t like it? It is
one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you
like to ask for it. I must have it.”"
174,2,69,"“It is not my property, Harry.”"
174,2,70,“Whose property is it?”
174,2,71,"“Dorian’s, of course,” answered the painter."
174,2,72,“He is a very lucky fellow.”
174,2,73,"“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon
his own portrait. “How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and
dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be
older than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other
way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was
to grow old! For that — for that — I would give everything! Yes, there is
nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for
that!”"
174,2,74,"“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord
Henry, laughing. “It would be rather hard lines on your work.”"
174,2,75,"“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward."
174,2,76,"Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. “I believe you would, Basil. You
like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a
green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.”"
174,2,77,"The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like
that. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed
and his cheeks burning."
174,2,78,"“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your
silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till
I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses
one’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your
picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth
is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I
shall kill myself.”"
174,2,79,"Hallward turned pale and caught his hand. “Dorian! Dorian!” he cried,
“don’t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I
shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,
are you? — you who are finer than any of them!”"
174,2,80,"“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of
the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must
lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives
something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture
could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint
it? It will mock me some day — mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled
into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the
divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying."
174,2,81,"“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly."
174,2,82,"Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It is the real Dorian Gray — that is
all.”"
174,2,83,“It is not.”
174,2,84,"“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”"
174,2,85,"“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered."
174,2,86,"“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer."
174,2,87,"“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between
you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever
done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will
not let it come across our three lives and mar them.”"
174,2,88,"Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid
face and tear - stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal
painting - table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was
he doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin
tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for the long
palette - knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at
last. He was going to rip up the canvas."
174,2,89,"With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to
Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of
the studio. “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried. “It would be murder!”"
174,2,90,"“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said the painter
coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. “I never thought you
would.”"
174,2,91,"“Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I
feel that.”"
174,2,92,"“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and
sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.” And he walked
across the room and rang the bell for tea. “You will have tea, of
course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple
pleasures?”"
174,2,93,"“I adore simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry. “They are the last refuge
of the complex. But I don’t like scenes, except on the stage. What
absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as
a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man
is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after
all — though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You
had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn’t really
want it, and I really do.”"
174,2,94,"“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!”
cried Dorian Gray; “and I don’t allow people to call me a silly boy.”"
174,2,95,"“You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it
existed.”"
174,2,96,"“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you
don’t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.”"
174,2,97,"“I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.”"
174,2,98,“Ah! this morning! You have lived since then.”
174,2,99,"There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden
tea - tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a
rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.
Two globe - shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray
went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to
the table and examined what was under the covers."
174,2,100,"“Let us go to the theatre to - night,” said Lord Henry. “There is sure to
be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White’s, but it
is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am
ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent
engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have
all the surprise of candour.”"
174,2,101,"“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress - clothes,” muttered Hallward.
“And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”"
174,2,102,"“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the nineteenth
century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only
real colour - element left in modern life.”"
174,2,103,"“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”"
174,2,104,"“Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one
in the picture?”"
174,2,105,“Before either.”
174,2,106,"“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the
lad."
174,2,107,"“Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won’t you?”"
174,2,108,"“I can’t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.”"
174,2,109,"“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”"
174,2,110,“I should like that awfully.”
174,2,111,"The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.
“I shall stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly."
174,2,112,"“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, strolling
across to him. “Am I really like that?”"
174,2,113,“Yes; you are just like that.”
174,2,114,"“How wonderful, Basil!”"
174,2,115,"“At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,”
sighed Hallward. “That is something.”"
174,2,116,"“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry. “Why,
even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to
do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old
men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.”"
174,2,117,"“Don’t go to the theatre to - night, Dorian,” said Hallward. “Stop and
dine with me.”"
174,2,118,"“I can’t, Basil.”"
174,2,119,“Why?”
174,2,120,“Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.”
174,2,121,"“He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always
breaks his own. I beg you not to go.”"
174,2,122,Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.
174,2,123,“I entreat you.”
174,2,124,"The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them
from the tea - table with an amused smile."
174,2,125,"“I must go, Basil,” he answered."
174,2,126,"“Very well,” said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on
the tray. “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better
lose no time. Good - bye, Harry. Good - bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.
Come to - morrow.”"
174,2,127,“Certainly.”
174,2,128,“You won’t forget?”
174,2,129,"“No, of course not,” cried Dorian."
174,2,130,“And ... Harry!”
174,2,131,"“Yes, Basil?”"
174,2,132,"“Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.”"
174,2,133,“I have forgotten it.”
174,2,134,“I trust you.”
174,2,135,"“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing. “Come, Mr.
Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.
Good - bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.”"
174,2,136,"As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a
sofa, and a look of pain came into his face."
174,3,1,"At half - past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon
Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial
if somewhat rough - mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called
selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was
considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His
father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and
Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a
capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at
Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by
reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,
and his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his
father’s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat
foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months
later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great
aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large town
houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and
took most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the
management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself
for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of
having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of
burning wood on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when
the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them
for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied
him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn.
Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the
country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but
there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices."
174,3,2,"When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough
shooting - coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_. “Well,
Harry,” said the old gentleman, “what brings you out so early? I
thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till
five.”"
174,3,3,"“Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get
something out of you.”"
174,3,4,"“Money, I suppose,” said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. “Well, sit
down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine that
money is everything.”"
174,3,5,"“Yes,” murmured Lord Henry, settling his button - hole in his coat; “and
when they grow older they know it. But I don’t want money. It is only
people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay
mine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly
upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor’s tradesmen, and
consequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not
useful information, of course; useless information.”"
174,3,6,"“Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,
although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in
the Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let them in
now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure
humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite
enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for
him.”"
174,3,7,"“Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,” said
Lord Henry languidly."
174,3,8,"“Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?” asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy
white eyebrows."
174,3,9,"“That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who
he is. He is the last Lord Kelso’s grandson. His mother was a Devereux,
Lady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his mother. What
was she like? Whom did she marry? You have known nearly everybody in
your time, so you might have known her. I am very much interested in
Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him.”"
174,3,10,"“Kelso’s grandson!” echoed the old gentleman. “Kelso’s grandson! ... Of
course.... I knew his mother intimately. I believe I was at her
christening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret
Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless
young fellow — a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or
something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it
happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few
months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said
Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his
son - in - law in public — paid him, sir, to do it, paid him — and that the
fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed
up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time
afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she
never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl
died, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I had
forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his mother, he
must be a good - looking chap.”"
174,3,11,"“He is very good - looking,” assented Lord Henry."
174,3,12,"“I hope he will fall into proper hands,” continued the old man. “He
should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing
by him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby property came to her,
through her grandfather. Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a
mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad, I
was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble
who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made
quite a story of it. I didn’t dare show my face at Court for a month. I
hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies.”"
174,3,13,"“I don’t know,” answered Lord Henry. “I fancy that the boy will be well
off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me so. And ...
his mother was very beautiful?”"
174,3,14,"“Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,
Harry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could
understand. She could have married anybody she chose. Carlington was
mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the women of that family
were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.
Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed at
him, and there wasn’t a girl in London at the time who wasn’t after
him. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this
humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an
American? Ain’t English girls good enough for him?”"
174,3,15,"“It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.”"
174,3,16,"“I’ll back English women against the world, Harry,” said Lord Fermor,
striking the table with his fist."
174,3,17,“The betting is on the Americans.”
174,3,18,"“They don’t last, I am told,” muttered his uncle."
174,3,19,"“A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a
steeplechase. They take things flying. I don’t think Dartmoor has a
chance.”"
174,3,20,“Who are her people?” grumbled the old gentleman. “Has she got any?”
174,3,21,"Lord Henry shook his head. “American girls are as clever at concealing
their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,” he said,
rising to go."
174,3,22,"“They are pork - packers, I suppose?”"
174,3,23,"“I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor’s sake. I am told that
pork - packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after
politics.”"
174,3,24,“Is she pretty?”
174,3,25,"“She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the
secret of their charm.”"
174,3,26,"“Why can’t these American women stay in their own country? They are
always telling us that it is the paradise for women.”"
174,3,27,"“It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively
anxious to get out of it,” said Lord Henry. “Good - bye, Uncle George. I
shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the
information I wanted. I always like to know everything about my new
friends, and nothing about my old ones.”"
174,3,28,"“Where are you lunching, Harry?”"
174,3,29,"“At Aunt Agatha’s. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He is her latest
_protégé_.”"
174,3,30,"“Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with
her charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks that
I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.”"
174,3,31,"“All right, Uncle George, I’ll tell her, but it won’t have any effect.
Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their
distinguishing characteristic.”"
174,3,32,"The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his
servant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and
turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square."
174,3,33,"So that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it had
been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a
strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything
for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a
hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child
born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to
solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an
interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it
were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something
tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might
blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as
with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat
opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer
rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing
upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the
bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of
influence. No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul into
some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s
own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of
passion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though
it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in
that — perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited
and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and
grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,
whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be
fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the
white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for
us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made
a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to
fade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how
interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at
life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who
was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim
woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself,
Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there
had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful
things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it
were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they
were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose
shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something
like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had
first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the
coloured marbles of a sonnet - sequence? But in our own century it was
strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without
knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful
portrait. He would seek to dominate him — had already, indeed, half done
so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something
fascinating in this son of love and death."
174,3,34,"Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that he had
passed his aunt’s some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.
When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they
had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and
passed into the dining - room."
174,3,35,"“Late as usual, Harry,” cried his aunt, shaking her head at him."
174,3,36,"He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to
her, looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly from
the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek.
Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good - nature and
good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample
architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are
described by contemporary historians as stoutness. Next to her sat, on
her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who
followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the
best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in
accordance with a wise and well - known rule. The post on her left was
occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable
charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,
having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he
had to say before he was thirty. His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur,
one of his aunt’s oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so
dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn - book.
Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most
intelligent middle - aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement
in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely
earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once
himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of
them ever quite escape."
174,3,37,"“We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,” cried the duchess,
nodding pleasantly to him across the table. “Do you think he will
really marry this fascinating young person?”"
174,3,38,"“I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.”"
174,3,39,"“How dreadful!” exclaimed Lady Agatha. “Really, some one should
interfere.”"
174,3,40,"“I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American
dry - goods store,” said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious."
174,3,41,"“My uncle has already suggested pork - packing, Sir Thomas.”"
174,3,42,"“Dry - goods! What are American dry - goods?” asked the duchess, raising
her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb."
174,3,43,"“American novels,” answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail."
174,3,44,The duchess looked puzzled.
174,3,45,"“Don’t mind him, my dear,” whispered Lady Agatha. “He never means
anything that he says.”"
174,3,46,"“When America was discovered,” said the Radical member — and he began to
give some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a
subject, he exhausted his listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised
her privilege of interruption. “I wish to goodness it never had been
discovered at all!” she exclaimed. “Really, our girls have no chance
nowadays. It is most unfair.”"
174,3,47,"“Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,” said Mr.
Erskine; “I myself would say that it had merely been detected.”"
174,3,48,"“Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,” answered the
duchess vaguely. “I must confess that most of them are extremely
pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris.
I wish I could afford to do the same.”"
174,3,49,"“They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,” chuckled Sir
Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour’s cast - off clothes."
174,3,50,"“Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?” inquired the
duchess."
174,3,51,"“They go to America,” murmured Lord Henry."
174,3,52,"Sir Thomas frowned. “I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against
that great country,” he said to Lady Agatha. “I have travelled all over
it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are
extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.”"
174,3,53,"“But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?” asked Mr.
Erskine plaintively. “I don’t feel up to the journey.”"
174,3,54,"Sir Thomas waved his hand. “Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on
his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about
them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are
absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing
characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I
assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.”"
174,3,55,"“How dreadful!” cried Lord Henry. “I can stand brute force, but brute
reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It
is hitting below the intellect.”"
174,3,56,"“I do not understand you,” said Sir Thomas, growing rather red."
174,3,57,"“I do, Lord Henry,” murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile."
174,3,58,“Paradoxes are all very well in their way....” rejoined the baronet.
174,3,59,"“Was that a paradox?” asked Mr. Erskine. “I did not think so. Perhaps
it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality
we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we
can judge them.”"
174,3,60,"“Dear me!” said Lady Agatha, “how you men argue! I am sure I never can
make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with
you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the
East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love
his playing.”"
174,3,61,"“I want him to play to me,” cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked
down the table and caught a bright answering glance."
174,3,62,"“But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,” continued Lady Agatha."
174,3,63,"“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord Henry,
shrugging his shoulders. “I cannot sympathize with that. It is too
ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid
in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the
colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life’s sores,
the better.”"
174,3,64,"“Still, the East End is a very important problem,” remarked Sir Thomas
with a grave shake of the head."
174,3,65,"“Quite so,” answered the young lord. “It is the problem of slavery, and
we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.”"
174,3,66,"The politician looked at him keenly. “What change do you propose,
then?” he asked."
174,3,67,"Lord Henry laughed. “I don’t desire to change anything in England
except the weather,” he answered. “I am quite content with philosophic
contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through
an over - expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal
to science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is that
they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not
emotional.”"
174,3,68,"“But we have such grave responsibilities,” ventured Mrs. Vandeleur
timidly."
174,3,69,"“Terribly grave,” echoed Lady Agatha."
174,3,70,"Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. “Humanity takes itself too
seriously. It is the world’s original sin. If the caveman had known how
to laugh, history would have been different.”"
174,3,71,"“You are really very comforting,” warbled the duchess. “I have always
felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no
interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to look
her in the face without a blush.”"
174,3,72,"“A blush is very becoming, Duchess,” remarked Lord Henry."
174,3,73,"“Only when one is young,” she answered. “When an old woman like myself
blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell
me how to become young again.”"
174,3,74,"He thought for a moment. “Can you remember any great error that you
committed in your early days, Duchess?” he asked, looking at her across
the table."
174,3,75,"“A great many, I fear,” she cried."
174,3,76,"“Then commit them over again,” he said gravely. “To get back one’s
youth, one has merely to repeat one’s follies.”"
174,3,77,“A delightful theory!” she exclaimed. “I must put it into practice.”
174,3,78,"“A dangerous theory!” came from Sir Thomas’s tight lips. Lady Agatha
shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened."
174,3,79,"“Yes,” he continued, “that is one of the great secrets of life.
Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and
discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are
one’s mistakes.”"
174,3,80,A laugh ran round the table.
174,3,81,"He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and
transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent
with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went
on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and
catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her
wine - stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the
hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled
before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge
press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape - juice rose round
her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over
the vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary
improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him,
and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose
temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and
to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic,
irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they
followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him,
but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips
and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes."
174,3,82,"At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room
in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was
waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. “How annoying!” she
cried. “I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take
him to some absurd meeting at Willis’s Rooms, where he is going to be
in the chair. If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn’t
have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would
ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good - bye, Lord Henry, you are
quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I don’t know
what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some
night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?”"
174,3,83,"“For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,” said Lord Henry with a
bow."
174,3,84,"“Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,” she cried; “so mind you
come”; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the
other ladies."
174,3,85,"When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking
a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm."
174,3,86,"“You talk books away,” he said; “why don’t you write one?”"
174,3,87,"“I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I
should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely
as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is no literary public in
England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of
all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty
of literature.”"
174,3,88,"“I fear you are right,” answered Mr. Erskine. “I myself used to have
literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear young
friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really
meant all that you said to us at lunch?”"
174,3,89,"“I quite forget what I said,” smiled Lord Henry. “Was it all very bad?”"
174,3,90,"“Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if
anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being
primarily responsible. But I should like to talk to you about life. The
generation into which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you are
tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your
philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate
enough to possess.”"
174,3,91,"“I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It
has a perfect host, and a perfect library.”"
174,3,92,"“You will complete it,” answered the old gentleman with a courteous
bow. “And now I must bid good - bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at
the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there.”"
174,3,93,"“All of you, Mr. Erskine?”"
174,3,94,"“Forty of us, in forty arm - chairs. We are practising for an English
Academy of Letters.”"
174,3,95,"Lord Henry laughed and rose. “I am going to the park,” he cried."
174,3,96,"As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.
“Let me come with you,” he murmured."
174,3,97,"“But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,”
answered Lord Henry."
174,3,98,"“I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let
me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks so
wonderfully as you do.”"
174,3,99,"“Ah! I have talked quite enough for to - day,” said Lord Henry, smiling.
“All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with
me, if you care to.”"
174,4,1,"One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious
arm - chair, in the little library of Lord Henry’s house in Mayfair. It
was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled
wainscoting of olive - stained oak, its cream - coloured frieze and ceiling
of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,
long - fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette
by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for
Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies
that Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars and
parrot - tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small
leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot - coloured light of a
summer day in London."
174,4,2,"Lord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his
principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was
looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages
of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had
found in one of the book - cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the
Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going
away."
174,4,3,"At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. “How late you
are, Harry!” he murmured."
174,4,4,"“I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,” answered a shrill voice."
174,4,5,"He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. “I beg your pardon. I
thought — ”"
174,4,6,"“You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me
introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my
husband has got seventeen of them.”"
174,4,7,"“Not seventeen, Lady Henry?”"
174,4,8,"“Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the
opera.” She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her
vague forget - me - not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses always
looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.
She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never
returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look
picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was Victoria,
and she had a perfect mania for going to church."
174,4,9,"“That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?”"
174,4,10,"“Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner’s music better than
anybody’s. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other
people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, don’t you
think so, Mr. Gray?”"
174,4,11,"The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her
fingers began to play with a long tortoise - shell paper - knife."
174,4,12,"Dorian smiled and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so, Lady
Henry. I never talk during music — at least, during good music. If one
hears bad music, it is one’s duty to drown it in conversation.”"
174,4,13,"“Ah! that is one of Harry’s views, isn’t it, Mr. Gray? I always hear
Harry’s views from his friends. It is the only way I get to know of
them. But you must not think I don’t like good music. I adore it, but I
am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped
pianists — two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don’t know what it
is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are,
ain’t they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after
a time, don’t they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to
art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn’t it? You have never been to
any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I can’t afford
orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make one’s rooms
look so picturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for
you, to ask you something — I forget what it was — and I found Mr. Gray
here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the
same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been
most pleasant. I am so glad I’ve seen him.”"
174,4,14,"“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating his
dark, crescent - shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused
smile. “So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old
brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays
people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.”"
174,4,15,"“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an
awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. “I have promised to drive
with the duchess. Good - bye, Mr. Gray. Good - bye, Harry. You are dining
out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury’s.”"
174,4,16,"“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her
as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the
rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of
frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the
sofa."
174,4,17,"“Never marry a woman with straw - coloured hair, Dorian,” he said after a
few puffs."
174,4,18,"“Why, Harry?”"
174,4,19,“Because they are so sentimental.”
174,4,20,“But I like sentimental people.”
174,4,21,"“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women,
because they are curious: both are disappointed.”"
174,4,22,"“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That
is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do
everything that you say.”"
174,4,23,“Who are you in love with?” asked Lord Henry after a pause.
174,4,24,"“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing."
174,4,25,"Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “That is a rather commonplace
_début_.”"
174,4,26,"“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”"
174,4,27,“Who is she?”
174,4,28,“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”
174,4,29,“Never heard of her.”
174,4,30,"“No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius.”"
174,4,31,"“My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They
never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent
the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of
mind over morals.”"
174,4,32,"“Harry, how can you?”"
174,4,33,"“My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so
I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I
find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and
the coloured. The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a
reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to
supper. The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake,
however. They paint in order to try and look young. Our grandmothers
painted in order to try and talk brilliantly. _Rouge_ and _esprit_ used
to go together. That is all over now. As long as a woman can look ten
years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for
conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and
two of these can’t be admitted into decent society. However, tell me
about your genius. How long have you known her?”"
174,4,34,"“Ah! Harry, your views terrify me.”"
174,4,35,“Never mind that. How long have you known her?”
174,4,36,“About three weeks.”
174,4,37,“And where did you come across her?”
174,4,38,"“I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn’t be unsympathetic about it.
After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You
filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For days
after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged in
the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who
passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they
led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There
was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations....
Well, one evening about seven o’clock, I determined to go out in search
of some adventure. I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with
its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as
you once phrased it, must have something in store for me. I fancied a
thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I
remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we
first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret
of life. I don’t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered
eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black
grassless squares. About half - past eight I passed by an absurd little
theatre, with great flaring gas - jets and gaudy play - bills. A hideous
Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was
standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had greasy ringlets,
and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. ‘Have a
box, my Lord?’ he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an
air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry, that
amused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I
really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage - box. To the
present day I can’t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn’t — my dear
Harry, if I hadn’t — I should have missed the greatest romance of my
life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!”"
174,4,39,"“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you
should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the
first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will
always be in love with love. A _grande passion_ is the privilege of
people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes
of a country. Don’t be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for
you. This is merely the beginning.”"
174,4,40,“Do you think my nature so shallow?” cried Dorian Gray angrily.
174,4,41,“No; I think your nature so deep.”
174,4,42,“How do you mean?”
174,4,43,"“My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really
the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I
call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.
Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life
of the intellect — simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must
analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many
things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might
pick them up. But I don’t want to interrupt you. Go on with your
story.”"
174,4,44,"“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a
vulgar drop - scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the
curtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and
cornucopias, like a third - rate wedding - cake. The gallery and pit were
fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and
there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the
dress - circle. Women went about with oranges and ginger - beer, and there
was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.”"
174,4,45,“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.”
174,4,46,"“Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what
on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play - bill. What do you
think the play was, Harry?”"
174,4,47,"“I should think ‘The Idiot Boy’, or ‘Dumb but Innocent’. Our fathers
used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian,
the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is
not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandpères ont
toujours tort_.”"
174,4,48,"“This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I
must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare
done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a
sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There
was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a
cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop - scene
was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman,
with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a
beer - barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the
low - comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most
friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the
scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country - booth. But
Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a
little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of
dark - brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were
like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen
in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that
beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,
Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came
across me. And her voice — I never heard such a voice. It was very low at
first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one’s
ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a
distant hautboy. In the garden - scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy
that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There
were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You
know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane
are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear
them, and each of them says something different. I don’t know which to
follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is
everything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One
evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have
seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from
her lover’s lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of
Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.
She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and
given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been
innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike
throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary
women never appeal to one’s imagination. They are limited to their
century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as
easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is
no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and
chatter at tea - parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped
smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an
actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didn’t you tell me
that the only thing worth loving is an actress?”"
174,4,49,"“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”"
174,4,50,"“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”"
174,4,51,"“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary
charm in them, sometimes,” said Lord Henry."
174,4,52,“I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”
174,4,53,"“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life
you will tell me everything you do.”"
174,4,54,"“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things.
You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would
come and confess it to you. You would understand me.”"
174,4,55,"“People like you — the wilful sunbeams of life — don’t commit crimes,
Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And now
tell me — reach me the matches, like a good boy — thanks — what are your
actual relations with Sibyl Vane?”"
174,4,56,"Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.
“Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!”"
174,4,57,"“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,” said
Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. “But why
should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When
one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one
always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a
romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?”"
174,4,58,"“Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the
horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and
offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. I was
furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds
of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I
think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the
impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.”"
174,4,59,“I am not surprised.”
174,4,60,"“Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I
never even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and
confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy
against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought.”"
174,4,61,"“I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the other
hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all
expensive.”"
174,4,62,"“Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means,” laughed Dorian.
“By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre,
and I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly
recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the
place again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I
was a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though
he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told me once, with
an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to ‘The
Bard,’ as he insisted on calling him. He seemed to think it a
distinction.”"
174,4,63,"“It was a distinction, my dear Dorian — a great distinction. Most people
become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of
life. To have ruined one’s self over poetry is an honour. But when did
you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?”"
174,4,64,"“The third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not help going
round. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me — at least
I fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He seemed
determined to take me behind, so I consented. It was curious my not
wanting to know her, wasn’t it?”"
174,4,65,“No; I don’t think so.”
174,4,66,"“My dear Harry, why?”"
174,4,67,“I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the girl.”
174,4,68,"“Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child
about her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her
what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of
her power. I think we were both rather nervous. The old Jew stood
grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate
speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like
children. He would insist on calling me ‘My Lord,’ so I had to assure
Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She said quite simply to me,
‘You look more like a prince. I must call you Prince Charming.’”"
174,4,69,"“Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.”"
174,4,70,"“You don’t understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a person in
a play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a faded
tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta
dressing - wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen
better days.”"
174,4,71,"“I know that look. It depresses me,” murmured Lord Henry, examining his
rings."
174,4,72,"“The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest
me.”"
174,4,73,"“You were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean about
other people’s tragedies.”"
174,4,74,"“Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came
from? From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and
entirely divine. Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every
night she is more marvellous.”"
174,4,75,"“That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now. I
thought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it is
not quite what I expected.”"
174,4,76,"“My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have
been to the opera with you several times,” said Dorian, opening his
blue eyes in wonder."
174,4,77,“You always come dreadfully late.”
174,4,78,"“Well, I can’t help going to see Sibyl play,” he cried, “even if it is
only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think
of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I
am filled with awe.”"
174,4,79,"“You can dine with me to - night, Dorian, can’t you?”"
174,4,80,"He shook his head. “To - night she is Imogen,” he answered, “and
to - morrow night she will be Juliet.”"
174,4,81,“When is she Sibyl Vane?”
174,4,82,“Never.”
174,4,83,“I congratulate you.”
174,4,84,"“How horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world in one.
She is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she has
genius. I love her, and I must make her love me. You, who know all the
secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I want to
make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our
laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their
dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God, Harry,
how I worship her!” He was walking up and down the room as he spoke.
Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. He was terribly excited."
174,4,85,"Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different
he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward’s
studio! His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of
scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding - place had crept his soul, and
desire had come to meet it on the way."
174,4,86,“And what do you propose to do?” said Lord Henry at last.
174,4,87,"“I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act. I
have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to
acknowledge her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jew’s hands.
She is bound to him for three years — at least for two years and eight
months — from the present time. I shall have to pay him something, of
course. When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and
bring her out properly. She will make the world as mad as she has made
me.”"
174,4,88,"“That would be impossible, my dear boy.”"
174,4,89,"“Yes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art - instinct, in
her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it
is personalities, not principles, that move the age.”"
174,4,90,"“Well, what night shall we go?”"
174,4,91,"“Let me see. To - day is Tuesday. Let us fix to - morrow. She plays Juliet
to - morrow.”"
174,4,92,“All right. The Bristol at eight o’clock; and I will get Basil.”
174,4,93,"“Not eight, Harry, please. Half - past six. We must be there before the
curtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she meets
Romeo.”"
174,4,94,"“Half - past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat - tea, or
reading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines before
seven. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I write to
him?”"
174,4,95,"“Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is rather
horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful
frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous
of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit
that I delight in it. Perhaps you had better write to him. I don’t want
to see him alone. He says things that annoy me. He gives me good
advice.”"
174,4,96,"Lord Henry smiled. “People are very fond of giving away what they need
most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.”"
174,4,97,"“Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit
of a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered
that.”"
174,4,98,"“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his
work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his
prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I
have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good
artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly
uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is
the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely
fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they
look. The mere fact of having published a book of second - rate sonnets
makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot
write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”"
174,4,99,"“I wonder is that really so, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, putting some
perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold - topped bottle that
stood on the table. “It must be, if you say it. And now I am off.
Imogen is waiting for me. Don’t forget about to - morrow. Good - bye.”"
174,4,100,"As he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began
to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as
Dorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused
him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by
it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled
by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject - matter of
that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had
begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.
Human life — that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.
Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as
one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one
could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous
fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with
monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle
that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were
maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to
understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received!
How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard
logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect — to
observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they
were in unison, and at what point they were at discord — there was a
delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too
high a price for any sensation."
174,4,101,"He was conscious — and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his
brown agate eyes — that it was through certain words of his, musical
words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned
to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent
the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That was
something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its
secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were
revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect
of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately
with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex
personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,
in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,
just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting."
174,4,102,"Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was
yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was
becoming self - conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his
beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It
was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one
of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be
remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and
whose wounds are like red roses."
174,4,103,"Soul and body, body and soul — how mysterious they were! There was
animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.
The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say
where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How
shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And
yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!
Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body
really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit
from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a
mystery also."
174,4,104,"He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a
science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it
was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.
Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to
their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of
warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation
of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow
and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in
experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.
All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same
as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we
would do many times, and with joy."
174,4,105,"It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by
which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and
certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to
promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane
was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt
that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new
experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex
passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of
boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,
changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from
sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the
passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most
strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we
were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were
experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves."
174,4,106,"While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the
door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for
dinner. He got up and looked out into the street. The sunset had
smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The
panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like a
faded rose. He thought of his friend’s young fiery - coloured life and
wondered how it was all going to end."
174,4,107,"When he arrived home, about half - past twelve o’clock, he saw a telegram
lying on the hall table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian
Gray. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl
Vane."
174,5,1,"“Mother, Mother, I am so happy!” whispered the girl, burying her face
in the lap of the faded, tired - looking woman who, with back turned to
the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm - chair that their
dingy sitting - room contained. “I am so happy!” she repeated, “and you
must be happy, too!”"
174,5,2,"Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth - whitened hands on her
daughter’s head. “Happy!” she echoed, “I am only happy, Sibyl, when I
see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr. Isaacs
has been very good to us, and we owe him money.”"
174,5,3,"The girl looked up and pouted. “Money, Mother?” she cried, “what does
money matter? Love is more than money.”"
174,5,4,"“Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to
get a proper outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty
pounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.”"
174,5,5,"“He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,”
said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window."
174,5,6,"“I don’t know how we could manage without him,” answered the elder
woman querulously."
174,5,7,"Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed. “We don’t want him any more,
Mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now.” Then she paused. A rose
shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks. Quick breath parted the
petals of her lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion swept
over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress. “I love him,” she
said simply."
174,5,8,"“Foolish child! foolish child!” was the parrot - phrase flung in answer.
The waving of crooked, false - jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the
words."
174,5,9,"The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice. Her
eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a
moment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of a
dream had passed across them."
174,5,10,"Thin - lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at
prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name
of common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her prison of
passion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She had called on
memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search for him, and it
had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her mouth. Her eyelids
were warm with his breath."
174,5,11,"Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This
young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against
the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of
craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled."
174,5,12,"Suddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her.
“Mother, Mother,” she cried, “why does he love me so much? I know why I
love him. I love him because he is like what love himself should be.
But what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him. And yet — why, I
cannot tell — though I feel so much beneath him, I don’t feel humble. I
feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love
Prince Charming?”"
174,5,13,"The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her
cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil rushed to
her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her. “Forgive me,
Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it only pains
you because you loved him so much. Don’t look so sad. I am as happy
to - day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy for ever!”"
174,5,14,"“My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides,
what do you know of this young man? You don’t even know his name. The
whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away
to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you
should have shown more consideration. However, as I said before, if he
is rich ...”"
174,5,15,"“Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!”"
174,5,16,"Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical
gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a
stage - player, clasped her in her arms. At this moment, the door opened
and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He was
thick - set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat
clumsy in movement. He was not so finely bred as his sister. One would
hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.
Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile. She mentally
elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She felt sure that the
_tableau_ was interesting."
174,5,17,"“You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,” said the
lad with a good - natured grumble."
174,5,18,"“Ah! but you don’t like being kissed, Jim,” she cried. “You are a
dreadful old bear.” And she ran across the room and hugged him."
174,5,19,"James Vane looked into his sister’s face with tenderness. “I want you
to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don’t suppose I shall ever see
this horrid London again. I am sure I don’t want to.”"
174,5,20,"“My son, don’t say such dreadful things,” murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up
a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. She
felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. It would
have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation."
174,5,21,"“Why not, Mother? I mean it.”"
174,5,22,"“You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a
position of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in the
Colonies — nothing that I would call society — so when you have made your
fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.”"
174,5,23,"“Society!” muttered the lad. “I don’t want to know anything about that.
I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage. I
hate it.”"
174,5,24,"“Oh, Jim!” said Sibyl, laughing, “how unkind of you! But are you really
going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you were
going to say good - bye to some of your friends — to Tom Hardy, who gave
you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking
it. It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon. Where
shall we go? Let us go to the park.”"
174,5,25,"“I am too shabby,” he answered, frowning. “Only swell people go to the
park.”"
174,5,26,"“Nonsense, Jim,” she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat."
174,5,27,"He hesitated for a moment. “Very well,” he said at last, “but don’t be
too long dressing.” She danced out of the door. One could hear her
singing as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered overhead."
174,5,28,"He walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to
the still figure in the chair. “Mother, are my things ready?” he asked."
174,5,29,"“Quite ready, James,” she answered, keeping her eyes on her work. For
some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this
rough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when
their eyes met. She used to wonder if he suspected anything. The
silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.
She began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as
they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. “I hope you will be
contented, James, with your sea - faring life,” she said. “You must
remember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a
solicitor’s office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the
country often dine with the best families.”"
174,5,30,"“I hate offices, and I hate clerks,” he replied. “But you are quite
right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don’t
let her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her.”"
174,5,31,"“James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over Sibyl.”"
174,5,32,"“I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to
talk to her. Is that right? What about that?”"
174,5,33,"“You are speaking about things you don’t understand, James. In the
profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying
attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That was
when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at
present whether her attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt
that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always
most polite to me. Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and
the flowers he sends are lovely.”"
174,5,34,"“You don’t know his name, though,” said the lad harshly."
174,5,35,"“No,” answered his mother with a placid expression in her face. “He has
not yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of him. He
is probably a member of the aristocracy.”"
174,5,36,"James Vane bit his lip. “Watch over Sibyl, Mother,” he cried, “watch
over her.”"
174,5,37,"“My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special
care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why
she should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the
aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a
most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming couple.
His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.”"
174,5,38,"The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window - pane
with his coarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something when
the door opened and Sibyl ran in."
174,5,39,“How serious you both are!” she cried. “What is the matter?”
174,5,40,"“Nothing,” he answered. “I suppose one must be serious sometimes.
Good - bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o’clock. Everything is
packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.”"
174,5,41,"“Good - bye, my son,” she answered with a bow of strained stateliness."
174,5,42,"She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and
there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid."
174,5,43,"“Kiss me, Mother,” said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched the
withered cheek and warmed its frost."
174,5,44,"“My child! my child!” cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in
search of an imaginary gallery."
174,5,45,"“Come, Sibyl,” said her brother impatiently. He hated his mother’s
affectations."
174,5,46,"They went out into the flickering, wind - blown sunlight and strolled
down the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in wonder at the
sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill - fitting clothes, was in the
company of such a graceful, refined - looking girl. He was like a common
gardener walking with a rose."
174,5,47,"Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of
some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on
geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however,
was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. Her love was
trembling in laughter on her lips. She was thinking of Prince Charming,
and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him,
but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about
the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life
he was to save from the wicked, red - shirted bushrangers. For he was not
to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.
Oh, no! A sailor’s existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a
horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump - backed waves trying to get in, and a
black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long
screaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a
polite good - bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold - fields.
Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure
gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it
down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The
bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with
immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold - fields at all.
They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other
in bar - rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep - farmer,
and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful
heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase,
and rescue her. Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with
her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense
house in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.
But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money
foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much
more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and
to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. God was very
good, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and in a
few years he would come back quite rich and happy."
174,5,48,"The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart - sick
at leaving home."
174,5,49,"Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.
Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger
of Sibyl’s position. This young dandy who was making love to her could
mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated
him through some curious race - instinct for which he could not account,
and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was
conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother’s nature,
and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl’s happiness.
Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge
them; sometimes they forgive them."
174,5,50,"His mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that
he had brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he
had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears
one night as he waited at the stage - door, had set loose a train of
horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a
hunting - crop across his face. His brows knit together into a wedge - like
furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip."
174,5,51,"“You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,” cried Sibyl, “and I
am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say something.”"
174,5,52,“What do you want me to say?”
174,5,53,"“Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,” she answered,
smiling at him."
174,5,54,"He shrugged his shoulders. “You are more likely to forget me than I am
to forget you, Sibyl.”"
174,5,55,"She flushed. “What do you mean, Jim?” she asked."
174,5,56,"“You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me
about him? He means you no good.”"
174,5,57,"“Stop, Jim!” she exclaimed. “You must not say anything against him. I
love him.”"
174,5,58,"“Why, you don’t even know his name,” answered the lad. “Who is he? I
have a right to know.”"
174,5,59,"“He is called Prince Charming. Don’t you like the name. Oh! you silly
boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would think
him the most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will meet
him — when you come back from Australia. You will like him so much.
Everybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish you could come to the
theatre to - night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh!
how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have
him sitting there! To play for his delight! I am afraid I may frighten
the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass
one’s self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting ‘genius’ to his
loafers at the bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to - night he will
announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only,
Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor
beside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the
door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want rewriting.
They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring - time for me, I
think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.”"
174,5,60,"“He is a gentleman,” said the lad sullenly."
174,5,61,“A prince!” she cried musically. “What more do you want?”
174,5,62,“He wants to enslave you.”
174,5,63,“I shudder at the thought of being free.”
174,5,64,“I want you to beware of him.”
174,5,65,“To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.”
174,5,66,"“Sibyl, you are mad about him.”"
174,5,67,"She laughed and took his arm. “You dear old Jim, you talk as if you
were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will
know what it is. Don’t look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to
think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have
ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and
difficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new world,
and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the
smart people go by.”"
174,5,68,"They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip - beds across
the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust — tremulous
cloud of orris - root it seemed — hung in the panting air. The brightly
coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies."
174,5,69,"She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He
spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as
players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could not
communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all
the echo she could win. After some time she became silent. Suddenly she
caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open
carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past."
174,5,70,She started to her feet. “There he is!” she cried.
174,5,71,“Who?” said Jim Vane.
174,5,72,"“Prince Charming,” she answered, looking after the victoria."
174,5,73,"He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. “Show him to me. Which
is he? Point him out. I must see him!” he exclaimed; but at that moment
the Duke of Berwick’s four - in - hand came between, and when it had left
the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park."
174,5,74,"“He is gone,” murmured Sibyl sadly. “I wish you had seen him.”"
174,5,75,"“I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does
you any wrong, I shall kill him.”"
174,5,76,"She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air
like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close to
her tittered."
174,5,77,"“Come away, Jim; come away,” she whispered. He followed her doggedly as
she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he had said."
174,5,78,"When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There was pity
in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook her head at
him. “You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad - tempered boy, that
is all. How can you say such horrible things? You don’t know what you
are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you
would fall in love. Love makes people good, and what you said was
wicked.”"
174,5,79,"“I am sixteen,” he answered, “and I know what I am about. Mother is no
help to you. She doesn’t understand how to look after you. I wish now
that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck
the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn’t been signed.”"
174,5,80,"“Oh, don’t be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of those
silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am not going
to quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect
happiness. We won’t quarrel. I know you would never harm any one I
love, would you?”"
174,5,81,"“Not as long as you love him, I suppose,” was the sullen answer."
174,5,82,“I shall love him for ever!” she cried.
174,5,83,“And he?”
174,5,84,"“For ever, too!”"
174,5,85,“He had better.”
174,5,86,"She shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm. He
was merely a boy."
174,5,87,"At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to
their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o’clock, and
Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim insisted
that she should do so. He said that he would sooner part with her when
their mother was not present. She would be sure to make a scene, and he
detested scenes of every kind."
174,5,88,"In Sybil’s own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad’s heart,
and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him,
had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck,
and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her
with real affection. There were tears in his eyes as he went
downstairs."
174,5,89,"His mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his
unpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to his
meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the
stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of
street - cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that
was left to him."
174,5,90,"After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his
hands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been told to
him before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear, his mother
watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A tattered lace
handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he got
up and went to the door. Then he turned back and looked at her. Their
eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him."
174,5,91,"“Mother, I have something to ask you,” he said. Her eyes wandered
vaguely about the room. She made no answer. “Tell me the truth. I have
a right to know. Were you married to my father?”"
174,5,92,"She heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment,
the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,
had come at last, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure
it was a disappointment to her. The vulgar directness of the question
called for a direct answer. The situation had not been gradually led up
to. It was crude. It reminded her of a bad rehearsal."
174,5,93,"“No,” she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life."
174,5,94,"“My father was a scoundrel then!” cried the lad, clenching his fists."
174,5,95,"She shook her head. “I knew he was not free. We loved each other very
much. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us. Don’t speak
against him, my son. He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he
was highly connected.”"
174,5,96,"An oath broke from his lips. “I don’t care for myself,” he exclaimed,
“but don’t let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn’t it, who is in love
with her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I suppose.”"
174,5,97,"For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her
head drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. “Sibyl has a
mother,” she murmured; “I had none.”"
174,5,98,"The lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed
her. “I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,” he
said, “but I could not help it. I must go now. Good - bye. Don’t forget
that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me
that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him
down, and kill him like a dog. I swear it.”"
174,5,99,"The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that
accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid
to her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breathed more freely,
and for the first time for many months she really admired her son. She
would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional
scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers
looked for. The lodging - house drudge bustled in and out. There was the
bargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in vulgar details. It
was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the
tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away. She
was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled
herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now
that she had only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase.
It had pleased her. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and
dramatically expressed. She felt that they would all laugh at it some
day."
174,6,1,"“I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?” said Lord Henry that
evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol
where dinner had been laid for three."
174,6,2,"“No, Harry,” answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing
waiter. “What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They don’t
interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons
worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little
whitewashing.”"
174,6,3,"“Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,” said Lord Henry, watching him
as he spoke."
174,6,4,"Hallward started and then frowned. “Dorian engaged to be married!” he
cried. “Impossible!”"
174,6,5,“It is perfectly true.”
174,6,6,“To whom?”
174,6,7,“To some little actress or other.”
174,6,8,“I can’t believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.”
174,6,9,"“Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear
Basil.”"
174,6,10,"“Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.”"
174,6,11,"“Except in America,” rejoined Lord Henry languidly. “But I didn’t say
he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a great
difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have
no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I
never was engaged.”"
174,6,12,"“But think of Dorian’s birth, and position, and wealth. It would be
absurd for him to marry so much beneath him.”"
174,6,13,"“If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is
sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it
is always from the noblest motives.”"
174,6,14,"“I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don’t want to see Dorian tied to
some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his
intellect.”"
174,6,15,"“Oh, she is better than good — she is beautiful,” murmured Lord Henry,
sipping a glass of vermouth and orange - bitters. “Dorian says she is
beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your
portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal
appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst
others. We are to see her to - night, if that boy doesn’t forget his
appointment.”"
174,6,16,“Are you serious?”
174,6,17,"“Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever
be more serious than I am at the present moment.”"
174,6,18,"“But do you approve of it, Harry?” asked the painter, walking up and
down the room and biting his lip. “You can’t approve of it, possibly.
It is some silly infatuation.”"
174,6,19,"“I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd
attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air
our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people
say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a
personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality
selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with
a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not?
If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting. You know
I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that
it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack
individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage
makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other
egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more
highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the
object of man’s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and
whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I
hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore
her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one
else. He would be a wonderful study.”"
174,6,20,"“You don’t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don’t.
If Dorian Gray’s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than
yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be.”"
174,6,21,"Lord Henry laughed. “The reason we all like to think so well of others
is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer
terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour
with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to
us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find
good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our
pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest
contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but
one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have
merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly,
but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I
will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being
fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I
can.”"
174,6,22,"“My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!” said the
lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin - lined wings and
shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. “I have never been so
happy. Of course, it is sudden — all really delightful things are. And
yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my
life.” He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked
extraordinarily handsome."
174,6,23,"“I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,” said Hallward, “but I
don’t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.
You let Harry know.”"
174,6,24,"“And I don’t forgive you for being late for dinner,” broke in Lord
Henry, putting his hand on the lad’s shoulder and smiling as he spoke.
“Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and
then you will tell us how it all came about.”"
174,6,25,"“There is really not much to tell,” cried Dorian as they took their
seats at the small round table. “What happened was simply this. After I
left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that
little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and
went down at eight o’clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind.
Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl!
You should have seen her! When she came on in her boy’s clothes, she
was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss - coloured velvet jerkin with
cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross - gartered hose, a dainty little
green cap with a hawk’s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak
lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had
all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your
studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round
a pale rose. As for her acting — well, you shall see her to - night. She is
simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I
forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away
with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the
performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were
sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had
never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each
other. I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to
me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of
rose - coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white
narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I
feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it. Of
course, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own
mother. I don’t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to
be furious. I don’t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and
then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven’t I, to take
my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare’s plays? Lips
that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.
I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the
mouth.”"
174,6,26,"“Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,” said Hallward slowly."
174,6,27,“Have you seen her to - day?” asked Lord Henry.
174,6,28,"Dorian Gray shook his head. “I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall
find her in an orchard in Verona.”"
174,6,29,"Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. “At what
particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what
did she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.”"
174,6,30,"“My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did
not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said
she was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is
nothing to me compared with her.”"
174,6,31,"“Women are wonderfully practical,” murmured Lord Henry, “much more
practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to
say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.”"
174,6,32,"Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. “Don’t, Harry. You have annoyed
Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any
one. His nature is too fine for that.”"
174,6,33,"Lord Henry looked across the table. “Dorian is never annoyed with me,”
he answered. “I asked the question for the best reason possible, for
the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any
question — simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the women
who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women. Except, of
course, in middle - class life. But then the middle classes are not
modern.”"
174,6,34,"Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. “You are quite incorrigible,
Harry; but I don’t mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When
you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her
would be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any
one can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I want to
place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman
who is mine. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. You mock at it for
that. Ah! don’t mock. It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her
trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good. When I am with her,
I regret all that you have taught me. I become different from what you
have known me to be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane’s
hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous,
delightful theories.”"
174,6,35,"“And those are ...?” asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad."
174,6,36,"“Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories
about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry.”"
174,6,37,"“Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,” he answered
in his slow melodious voice. “But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory
as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature’s test,
her sign of approval. When we are happy, we are always good, but when
we are good, we are not always happy.”"
174,6,38,“Ah! but what do you mean by good?” cried Basil Hallward.
174,6,39,"“Yes,” echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord
Henry over the heavy clusters of purple - lipped irises that stood in the
centre of the table, “what do you mean by good, Harry?”"
174,6,40,"“To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self,” he replied, touching
the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine - pointed fingers.
“Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One’s own
life — that is the important thing. As for the lives of one’s neighbours,
if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one’s moral
views about them, but they are not one’s concern. Besides,
individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in
accepting the standard of one’s age. I consider that for any man of
culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest
immorality.”"
174,6,41,"“But, surely, if one lives merely for one’s self, Harry, one pays a
terrible price for doing so?” suggested the painter."
174,6,42,"“Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy that
the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but
self - denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege
of the rich.”"
174,6,43,“One has to pay in other ways but money.”
174,6,44,"“What sort of ways, Basil?”"
174,6,45,"“Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the
consciousness of degradation.”"
174,6,46,"Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, mediæval art is
charming, but mediæval emotions are out of date. One can use them in
fiction, of course. But then the only things that one can use in
fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me,
no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever
knows what a pleasure is.”"
174,6,47,"“I know what pleasure is,” cried Dorian Gray. “It is to adore some
one.”"
174,6,48,"“That is certainly better than being adored,” he answered, toying with
some fruits. “Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as
humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us
to do something for them.”"
174,6,49,"“I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to
us,” murmured the lad gravely. “They create love in our natures. They
have a right to demand it back.”"
174,6,50,"“That is quite true, Dorian,” cried Hallward."
174,6,51,"“Nothing is ever quite true,” said Lord Henry."
174,6,52,"“This is,” interrupted Dorian. “You must admit, Harry, that women give
to men the very gold of their lives.”"
174,6,53,"“Possibly,” he sighed, “but they invariably want it back in such very
small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once
put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always
prevent us from carrying them out.”"
174,6,54,"“Harry, you are dreadful! I don’t know why I like you so much.”"
174,6,55,"“You will always like me, Dorian,” he replied. “Will you have some
coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine - champagne_, and
some cigarettes. No, don’t mind the cigarettes — I have some. Basil, I
can’t allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette
is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it
leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will
always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never
had the courage to commit.”"
174,6,56,"“What nonsense you talk, Harry!” cried the lad, taking a light from a
fire - breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.
“Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will
have a new ideal of life. She will represent something to you that you
have never known.”"
174,6,57,"“I have known everything,” said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his
eyes, “but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid, however,
that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your wonderful
girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life.
Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry, Basil, but
there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a
hansom.”"
174,6,58,"They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The
painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He
could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better
than many other things that might have happened. After a few minutes,
they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had been
arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in
front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that
Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the
past. Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded
flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew up at the
theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older."
174,7,1,"For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat
Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with
an oily tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of
pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top
of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he
had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry,
upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and
insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud
to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a
poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The
heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a
monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery
had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.
They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges
with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in
the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of
the popping of corks came from the bar."
174,7,2,“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.
174,7,3,"“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray. “It was here I found her, and she is
divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget
everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and
brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They
sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to
do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them,
and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one’s self.”"
174,7,4,"“The same flesh and blood as one’s self! Oh, I hope not!” exclaimed
Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his
opera - glass."
174,7,5,"“Don’t pay any attention to him, Dorian,” said the painter. “I
understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love
must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must
be fine and noble. To spiritualize one’s age — that is something worth
doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without
one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have
been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and
lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of
all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage
is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The
gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been
incomplete.”"
174,7,6,"“Thanks, Basil,” answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. “I knew that
you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me. But here
is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about
five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom
I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is
good in me.”"
174,7,7,"A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of
applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly
lovely to look at — one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,
that he had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace
and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror
of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded
enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to
tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud.
Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord
Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, “Charming! charming!”"
174,7,8,"The scene was the hall of Capulet’s house, and Romeo in his pilgrim’s
dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The band, such
as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through
the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a
creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a
plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a
white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory."
174,7,9,"Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes
rested on Romeo. The few words she had to speak —"
174,7,10,"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss —"
174,7,11,"with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly
artificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view
of tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away
all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal."
174,7,12,"Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious.
Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them
to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed."
174,7,13,"Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of
the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was
nothing in her."
174,7,14,"She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be
denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse
as she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial. She
overemphasized everything that she had to say. The beautiful passage —"
174,7,15,"Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to - night —"
174,7,16,"was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been
taught to recite by some second - rate professor of elocution. When she
leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines —"
174,7,17,"Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to - night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say, “It lightens.” Sweet, good - night!
This bud of love by summer’s ripening breath
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet —"
174,7,18,"she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was
not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely
self - contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure."
174,7,19,"Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their
interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and
to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the
dress - circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was
the girl herself."
174,7,20,"When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord
Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat. “She is quite
beautiful, Dorian,” he said, “but she can’t act. Let us go.”"
174,7,21,"“I am going to see the play through,” answered the lad, in a hard
bitter voice. “I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an
evening, Harry. I apologize to you both.”"
174,7,22,"“My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,” interrupted
Hallward. “We will come some other night.”"
174,7,23,"“I wish she were ill,” he rejoined. “But she seems to me to be simply
callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great
artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.”"
174,7,24,"“Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more
wonderful thing than art.”"
174,7,25,"“They are both simply forms of imitation,” remarked Lord Henry. “But do
let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good
for one’s morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don’t suppose you will
want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like
a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about
life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.
There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating — people
who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.
Good heavens, my dear boy, don’t look so tragic! The secret of
remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to
the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to
the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?”"
174,7,26,"“Go away, Harry,” cried the lad. “I want to be alone. Basil, you must
go. Ah! can’t you see that my heart is breaking?” The hot tears came to
his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he
leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands."
174,7,27,"“Let us go, Basil,” said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his
voice, and the two young men passed out together."
174,7,28,"A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose
on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale,
and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed
interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots
and laughing. The whole thing was a _fiasco_. The last act was played
to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter and some
groans."
174,7,29,"As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the
greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on
her face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a
radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of
their own."
174,7,30,"When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy
came over her. “How badly I acted to - night, Dorian!” she cried."
174,7,31,"“Horribly!” he answered, gazing at her in amazement. “Horribly! It was
dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea
what I suffered.”"
174,7,32,"The girl smiled. “Dorian,” she answered, lingering over his name with
long - drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to
the red petals of her mouth. “Dorian, you should have understood. But
you understand now, don’t you?”"
174,7,33,"“Understand what?” he asked, angrily."
174,7,34,"“Why I was so bad to - night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall
never act well again.”"
174,7,35,"He shrugged his shoulders. “You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill
you shouldn’t act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored.
I was bored.”"
174,7,36,"She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An
ecstasy of happiness dominated her."
174,7,37,"“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was the one
reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought
that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.
The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine
also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me
seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew
nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came — oh, my beautiful
love! — and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality
really is. To - night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the
hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had
always played. To - night, for the first time, I became conscious that
the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the
orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I
had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to
say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is
but a reflection. You had made me understand what love really is. My
love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of
shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do
with the puppets of a play? When I came on to - night, I could not
understand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that
I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly
it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to
me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love
such as ours? Take me away, Dorian — take me away with you, where we can
be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not
feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian,
Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it
would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me
see that.”"
174,7,38,"He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. “You have
killed my love,” he muttered."
174,7,39,"She looked at him in wonder and laughed. He made no answer. She came
across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair. She knelt
down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a
shudder ran through him."
174,7,40,"Then he leaped up and went to the door. “Yes,” he cried, “you have
killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don’t even
stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because
you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you
realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the
shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and
stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You
are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think
of you. I will never mention your name. You don’t know what you were to
me, once. Why, once ... Oh, I can’t bear to think of it! I wish I had
never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How
little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! Without your
art, you are nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid,
magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have
borne my name. What are you now? A third - rate actress with a pretty
face.”"
174,7,41,"The girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands together, and
her voice seemed to catch in her throat. “You are not serious, Dorian?”
she murmured. “You are acting.”"
174,7,42,"“Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,” he answered bitterly."
174,7,43,"She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her
face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm and
looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. “Don’t touch me!” he cried."
174,7,44,"A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay
there like a trampled flower. “Dorian, Dorian, don’t leave me!” she
whispered. “I am so sorry I didn’t act well. I was thinking of you all
the time. But I will try — indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across
me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had
not kissed me — if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love.
Don’t go away from me. I couldn’t bear it. Oh! don’t go away from me.
My brother ... No; never mind. He didn’t mean it. He was in jest....
But you, oh! can’t you forgive me for to - night? I will work so hard and
try to improve. Don’t be cruel to me, because I love you better than
anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not
pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown
myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn’t help
it. Oh, don’t leave me, don’t leave me.” A fit of passionate sobbing
choked her. She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian
Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled
lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous
about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane
seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed
him."
174,7,45,"“I am going,” he said at last in his calm clear voice. “I don’t wish to
be unkind, but I can’t see you again. You have disappointed me.”"
174,7,46,"She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little
hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He
turned on his heel and left the room. In a few moments he was out of
the theatre."
174,7,47,"Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly
lit streets, past gaunt, black - shadowed archways and evil - looking
houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after
him. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like
monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door - steps,
and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts."
174,7,48,"As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.
The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed
itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies
rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with
the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an
anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market and watched the men
unloading their waggons. A white - smocked carter offered him some
cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money
for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at
midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long
line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red
roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge,
jade - green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey,
sun - bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,
waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging
doors of the coffee - house in the piazza. The heavy cart - horses slipped
and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.
Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris - necked
and pink - footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds."
174,7,49,"After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few
moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent
square, with its blank, close - shuttered windows and its staring blinds.
The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like
silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke
was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre - coloured air."
174,7,50,"In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge’s barge, that
hung from the ceiling of the great, oak - panelled hall of entrance,
lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals
of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He turned them out and,
having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library
towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the
ground floor that, in his new - born feeling for luxury, he had just had
decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries
that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As
he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait
Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise.
Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he
had taken the button - hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.
Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In
the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream - coloured silk
blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The expression
looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty
in the mouth. It was certainly strange."
174,7,51,"He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The
bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky
corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he
had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be
more intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the
lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking
into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing."
174,7,52,"He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory
Cupids, one of Lord Henry’s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly
into its polished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What
did it mean?"
174,7,53,"He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it
again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual
painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had
altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly
apparent."
174,7,54,"He threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there
flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio the
day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He
had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the
portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the
face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that
the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and
thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness
of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been
fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to
think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the
touch of cruelty in the mouth."
174,7,55,"Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl’s fault, not his. He had
dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he
had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been
shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over
him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little
child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had
he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he
had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had
lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His
life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had
wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear
sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of
their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one
with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and
Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl
Vane? She was nothing to him now."
174,7,56,"But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his
life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty.
Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it
again?"
174,7,57,"No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The
horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly
there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men
mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so."
174,7,58,"Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel
smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met
his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted
image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would
alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses
would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and
wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or
unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would
resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any more — would not, at
any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil
Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion for
impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends,
marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She
must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish
and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would
return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be
beautiful and pure."
174,7,59,"He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the
portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. “How horrible!” he murmured
to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he
stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning
air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of
Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name
over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew - drenched
garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her."
174,8,1,"It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times
on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered
what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and
Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a
small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive - satin curtains,
with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall
windows."
174,8,2,"“Monsieur has well slept this morning,” he said, smiling."
174,8,3,"“What o’clock is it, Victor?” asked Dorian Gray drowsily."
174,8,4,"“One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.”"
174,8,5,"How late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his
letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand
that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The
others he opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection of
cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of
charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young
men every morning during the season. There was a rather heavy bill for
a chased silver Louis - Quinze toilet - set that he had not yet had the
courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old - fashioned
people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary
things are our only necessities; and there were several very
courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money - lenders
offering to advance any sum of money at a moment’s notice and at the
most reasonable rates of interest."
174,8,6,"After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate
dressing - gown of silk - embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the
onyx - paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.
He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense
of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice,
but there was the unreality of a dream about it."
174,8,7,"As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a
light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round
table close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air
seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in and buzzed round the
blue - dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur - yellow roses, stood before
him. He felt perfectly happy."
174,8,8,"Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the
portrait, and he started."
174,8,9,"“Too cold for Monsieur?” asked his valet, putting an omelette on the
table. “I shut the window?”"
174,8,10,"Dorian shook his head. “I am not cold,” he murmured."
174,8,11,"Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply
his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there
had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The
thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It
would make him smile."
174,8,12,"And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in
the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of
cruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the
room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the
portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes
had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to
tell him to remain. As the door was closing behind him, he called him
back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian looked at him for a
moment. “I am not at home to any one, Victor,” he said with a sigh. The
man bowed and retired."
174,8,13,"Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on
a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen
was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a
rather florid Louis - Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously,
wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man’s life."
174,8,14,"Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was
the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was
not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier
chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change?
What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own
picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be
examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful
state of doubt."
174,8,15,"He got up and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he
looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside and
saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had
altered."
174,8,16,"As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he
found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost
scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was
incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle
affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form
and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him? Could it be
that what that soul thought, they realized? — that what it dreamed, they
made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered,
and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the
picture in sickened horror."
174,8,17,"One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him
conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not
too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His
unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be
transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil
Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would
be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the
fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could
lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the
degradation of sin. Here was an ever - present sign of the ruin men
brought upon their souls."
174,8,18,"Three o’clock struck, and four, and the half - hour rang its double
chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the
scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his
way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was
wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he
went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had
loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. He
covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of
pain. There is a luxury in self - reproach. When we blame ourselves, we
feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,
not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the
letter, he felt that he had been forgiven."
174,8,19,"Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry’s
voice outside. “My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can’t
bear your shutting yourself up like this.”"
174,8,20,"He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking
still continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry
in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel
with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was
inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,
and unlocked the door."
174,8,21,"“I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,” said Lord Henry as he entered. “But
you must not think too much about it.”"
174,8,22,“Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?” asked the lad.
174,8,23,"“Yes, of course,” answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly
pulling off his yellow gloves. “It is dreadful, from one point of view,
but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her,
after the play was over?”"
174,8,24,“Yes.”
174,8,25,“I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?”
174,8,26,"“I was brutal, Harry — perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am
not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know
myself better.”"
174,8,27,"“Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would
find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.”"
174,8,28,"“I have got through all that,” said Dorian, shaking his head and
smiling. “I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin
with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in
us. Don’t sneer at it, Harry, any more — at least not before me. I want
to be good. I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.”"
174,8,29,"“A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you
on it. But how are you going to begin?”"
174,8,30,“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”
174,8,31,"“Marrying Sibyl Vane!” cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him
in perplexed amazement. “But, my dear Dorian — ”"
174,8,32,"“Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about
marriage. Don’t say it. Don’t ever say things of that kind to me again.
Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word
to her. She is to be my wife.”"
174,8,33,"“Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn’t you get my letter? I wrote to you this
morning, and sent the note down by my own man.”"
174,8,34,"“Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was
afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn’t like. You cut
life to pieces with your epigrams.”"
174,8,35,“You know nothing then?”
174,8,36,“What do you mean?”
174,8,37,"Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray,
took both his hands in his own and held them tightly. “Dorian,” he
said, “my letter — don’t be frightened — was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is
dead.”"
174,8,38,"A cry of pain broke from the lad’s lips, and he leaped to his feet,
tearing his hands away from Lord Henry’s grasp. “Dead! Sibyl dead! It
is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?”"
174,8,39,"“It is quite true, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, gravely. “It is in all the
morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till
I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not
be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.
But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make
one’s _début_ with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an
interest to one’s old age. I suppose they don’t know your name at the
theatre? If they don’t, it is all right. Did any one see you going
round to her room? That is an important point.”"
174,8,40,"Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror.
Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, “Harry, did you say an
inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl — ? Oh, Harry, I can’t bear
it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.”"
174,8,41,"“I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put
in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre
with her mother, about half - past twelve or so, she said she had
forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but she
did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the
floor of her dressing - room. She had swallowed something by mistake,
some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don’t know what it was, but
it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was
prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.”"
174,8,42,"“Harry, Harry, it is terrible!” cried the lad."
174,8,43,"“Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed
up in it. I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen. I should have
thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and
seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn’t let this
thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and
afterwards we will look in at the opera. It is a Patti night, and
everybody will be there. You can come to my sister’s box. She has got
some smart women with her.”"
174,8,44,"“So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,” said Dorian Gray, half to himself,
“murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.
Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as
happily in my garden. And to - night I am to dine with you, and then go
on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How
extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book,
Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has
happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.
Here is the first passionate love - letter I have ever written in my
life. Strange, that my first passionate love - letter should have been
addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent
people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh,
Harry, how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was
everything to me. Then came that dreadful night — was it really only last
night? — when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She
explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a
bit. I thought her shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me
afraid. I can’t tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I said I
would go back to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My
God! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You don’t know the danger I am in,
and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for
me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her.”"
174,8,45,"“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case
and producing a gold - latten matchbox, “the only way a woman can ever
reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible
interest in life. If you had married this girl, you would have been
wretched. Of course, you would have treated her kindly. One can always
be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon
found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman
finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy,
or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman’s husband has to pay
for. I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been
abject — which, of course, I would not have allowed — but I assure you that
in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.”"
174,8,46,"“I suppose it would,” muttered the lad, walking up and down the room
and looking horribly pale. “But I thought it was my duty. It is not my
fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right.
I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good
resolutions — that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were.”"
174,8,47,"“Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific
laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely _nil_.
They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions
that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said
for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they
have no account.”"
174,8,48,"“Harry,” cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,
“why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I
don’t think I am heartless. Do you?”"
174,8,49,"“You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be
entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry with
his sweet melancholy smile."
174,8,50,"The lad frowned. “I don’t like that explanation, Harry,” he rejoined,
“but I am glad you don’t think I am heartless. I am nothing of the
kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has
happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply
like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible
beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but
by which I have not been wounded.”"
174,8,51,"“It is an interesting question,” said Lord Henry, who found an
exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism, “an
extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is
this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an
inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their
absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack
of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an
impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes,
however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses
our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply
appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are
no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are
both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle
enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened?
Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had
such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the
rest of my life. The people who have adored me — there have not been very
many, but there have been some — have always insisted on living on, long
after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have
become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for
reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is!
And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb
the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details
are always vulgar.”"
174,8,52,"“I must sow poppies in my garden,” sighed Dorian."
174,8,53,"“There is no necessity,” rejoined his companion. “Life has always
poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once
wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic
mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did
die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice
the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one
with the terror of eternity. Well — would you believe it? — a week ago, at
Lady Hampshire’s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in
question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and
digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance
in a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out again and assured me that I
had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous
dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she
showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women
never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act,
and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose
to continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would
have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.
They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are
more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the
women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.
Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going
in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve,
whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty - five who is fond of
pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a
great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their
husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one’s face, as if it
were the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its
mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and
I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being
told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes;
there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern
life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.”"
174,8,54,"“What is that, Harry?” said the lad listlessly."
174,8,55,"“Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else’s admirer when one
loses one’s own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But
really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the
women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her
death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.
They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with,
such as romance, passion, and love.”"
174,8,56,“I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that.”
174,8,57,"“I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more
than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have
emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all
the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I
have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how
delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to me the day
before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful,
but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to
everything.”"
174,8,58,"“What was that, Harry?”"
174,8,59,"“You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of
romance — that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that
if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.”"
174,8,60,"“She will never come to life again now,” muttered the lad, burying his
face in his hands."
174,8,61,"“No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you
must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing - room simply as a
strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene
from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived,
and so she has never really died. To you at least she was always a
dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare’s plays and left them
lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare’s music
sounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she touched actual
life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn
for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was
strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio
died. But don’t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real
than they are.”"
174,8,62,"There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and
with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colours
faded wearily out of things."
174,8,63,"After some time Dorian Gray looked up. “You have explained me to
myself, Harry,” he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. “I felt
all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not
express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will not talk again
of what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience. That is all.
I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.”"
174,8,64,"“Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that
you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.”"
174,8,65,"“But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled? What
then?”"
174,8,66,"“Ah, then,” said Lord Henry, rising to go, “then, my dear Dorian, you
would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought to
you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads
too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We
cannot spare you. And now you had better dress and drive down to the
club. We are rather late, as it is.”"
174,8,67,"“I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat
anything. What is the number of your sister’s box?”"
174,8,68,"“Twenty - seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her
name on the door. But I am sorry you won’t come and dine.”"
174,8,69,"“I don’t feel up to it,” said Dorian listlessly. “But I am awfully
obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my
best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have.”"
174,8,70,"“We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,” answered Lord
Henry, shaking him by the hand. “Good - bye. I shall see you before
nine - thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing.”"
174,8,71,"As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in
a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.
He waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to take an
interminable time over everything."
174,8,72,"As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back. No;
there was no further change in the picture. It had received the news of
Sibyl Vane’s death before he had known of it himself. It was conscious
of the events of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty that marred
the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment
that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or was it
indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed
within the soul? He wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the
change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it."
174,8,73,"Poor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked
death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her and taken her
with him. How had she played that dreadful last scene? Had she cursed
him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love would
always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything by the
sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what
she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre.
When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent
on to the world’s stage to show the supreme reality of love. A
wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her
childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace. He
brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture."
174,8,74,"He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his
choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him — life, and
his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion,
pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins — he was to have
all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame:
that was all."
174,8,75,"A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that
was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery
of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips
that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had sat
before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as
it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which
he yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be
hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had
so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The
pity of it! the pity of it!"
174,8,76,"For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that
existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in
answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain
unchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender
the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance
might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?
Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer
that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious
scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence
upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon
dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire,
might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods
and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?
But the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a
prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to
alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?"
174,8,77,"For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to
follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him
the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so
it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he
would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.
When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of
chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one
blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life
would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and
fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured
image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything."
174,8,78,"He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,
smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was
already waiting for him. An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord
Henry was leaning over his chair."
174,9,1,"As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown
into the room."
174,9,2,"“I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,” he said gravely. “I called
last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew
that was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really
gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy
might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me
when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late
edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club. I came here at
once and was miserable at not finding you. I can’t tell you how
heart - broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer.
But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl’s mother? For a
moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the
paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn’t it? But I was afraid of
intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a
state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about
it all?”"
174,9,3,"“My dear Basil, how do I know?” murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some
pale - yellow wine from a delicate, gold - beaded bubble of Venetian glass
and looking dreadfully bored. “I was at the opera. You should have come
on there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry’s sister, for the first time. We
were in her box. She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.
Don’t talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn’t talk about a thing, it
has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives
reality to things. I may mention that she was not the woman’s only
child. There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe. But he is not on
the stage. He is a sailor, or something. And now, tell me about
yourself and what you are painting.”"
174,9,4,"“You went to the opera?” said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a
strained touch of pain in his voice. “You went to the opera while Sibyl
Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk to me of other
women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl
you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why, man, there
are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!”"
174,9,5,"“Stop, Basil! I won’t hear it!” cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. “You
must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past is
past.”"
174,9,6,“You call yesterday the past?”
174,9,7,"“What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only
shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is
master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a
pleasure. I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use
them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.”"
174,9,8,"“Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You
look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come
down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural,
and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the
whole world. Now, I don’t know what has come over you. You talk as if
you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harry’s influence. I see
that.”"
174,9,9,"The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few
moments on the green, flickering, sun - lashed garden. “I owe a great
deal to Harry, Basil,” he said at last, “more than I owe to you. You
only taught me to be vain.”"
174,9,10,"“Well, I am punished for that, Dorian — or shall be some day.”"
174,9,11,"“I don’t know what you mean, Basil,” he exclaimed, turning round. “I
don’t know what you want. What do you want?”"
174,9,12,"“I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,” said the artist sadly."
174,9,13,"“Basil,” said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his
shoulder, “you have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl
Vane had killed herself — ”"
174,9,14,"“Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?” cried
Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror."
174,9,15,"“My dear Basil! Surely you don’t think it was a vulgar accident? Of
course she killed herself.”"
174,9,16,"The elder man buried his face in his hands. “How fearful,” he muttered,
and a shudder ran through him."
174,9,17,"“No,” said Dorian Gray, “there is nothing fearful about it. It is one
of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act
lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful
wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean — middle - class virtue
and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her
finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played — the
night you saw her — she acted badly because she had known the reality of
love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.
She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the
martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of
martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not
think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular
moment — about half - past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six — you would
have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the
news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered
immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can,
except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come
down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled,
and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a
story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty
years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some
unjust law altered — I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded,
and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing
to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And
besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me
rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic
point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la
consolation des arts_? I remember picking up a little vellum - covered
book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.
Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at
Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could
console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that
one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer - work,
carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp — there is much to
be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create,
or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of
one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I
know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not
realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am
a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am
different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must
always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of Harry. But I know
that you are better than he is. You are not stronger — you are too much
afraid of life — but you are better. And how happy we used to be
together! Don’t leave me, Basil, and don’t quarrel with me. I am what I
am. There is nothing more to be said.”"
174,9,18,"The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him,
and his personality had been the great turning point in his art. He
could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After all, his
indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. There was
so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble."
174,9,19,"“Well, Dorian,” he said at length, with a sad smile, “I won’t speak to
you again about this horrible thing, after to - day. I only trust your
name won’t be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take
place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?”"
174,9,20,"Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at
the mention of the word “inquest.” There was something so crude and
vulgar about everything of the kind. “They don’t know my name,” he
answered."
174,9,21,“But surely she did?”
174,9,22,"“Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned
to any one. She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn
who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince
Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl,
Basil. I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a
few kisses and some broken pathetic words.”"
174,9,23,"“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you
must come and sit to me yourself again. I can’t get on without you.”"
174,9,24,"“I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!” he exclaimed,
starting back."
174,9,25,"The painter stared at him. “My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried. “Do
you mean to say you don’t like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have
you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best
thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply
disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room
looked different as I came in.”"
174,9,26,"“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don’t imagine I let
him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me sometimes — that
is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait.”"
174,9,27,"“Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for
it. Let me see it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room."
174,9,28,"A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between
the painter and the screen. “Basil,” he said, looking very pale, “you
must not look at it. I don’t wish you to.”"
174,9,29,"“Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn’t I look at
it?” exclaimed Hallward, laughing."
174,9,30,"“If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never
speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don’t offer
any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you
touch this screen, everything is over between us.”"
174,9,31,"Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute
amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was actually
pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes
were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over."
174,9,32,“Dorian!”
174,9,33,“Don’t speak!”
174,9,34,"“But what is the matter? Of course I won’t look at it if you don’t want
me to,” he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over
towards the window. “But, really, it seems rather absurd that I
shouldn’t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in
Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of
varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to - day?”"
174,9,35,"“To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?” exclaimed Dorian Gray, a
strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be
shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That
was impossible. Something — he did not know what — had to be done at once."
174,9,36,"“Yes; I don’t suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going
to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de
Sèze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will only
be away a month. I should think you could easily spare it for that
time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you keep it
always behind a screen, you can’t care much about it.”"
174,9,37,"Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of
perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible
danger. “You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,” he
cried. “Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for being
consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only difference
is that your moods are rather meaningless. You can’t have forgotten
that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would
induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the
same thing.” He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his
eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half
seriously and half in jest, “If you want to have a strange quarter of
an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won’t exhibit your picture. He
told me why he wouldn’t, and it was a revelation to me.” Yes, perhaps
Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try."
174,9,38,"“Basil,” he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in
the face, “we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall
tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my
picture?”"
174,9,39,"The painter shuddered in spite of himself. “Dorian, if I told you, you
might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I
could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me
never to look at your picture again, I am content. I have always you to
look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from
the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than any
fame or reputation.”"
174,9,40,"“No, Basil, you must tell me,” insisted Dorian Gray. “I think I have a
right to know.” His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity
had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil Hallward’s
mystery."
174,9,41,"“Let us sit down, Dorian,” said the painter, looking troubled. “Let us
sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the
picture something curious? — something that probably at first did not
strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?”"
174,9,42,"“Basil!” cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling
hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes."
174,9,43,"“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.
Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most
extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and
power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen
ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I
worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted
to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When
you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course,
I never let you know anything about this. It would have been
impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it
myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that
the world had become wonderful to my eyes — too wonderful, perhaps, for
in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less
than the peril of keeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew
more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn
you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and
polished boar - spear. Crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on
the prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You
had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the
water’s silent silver the marvel of your own face. And it had all been
what art should be — unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day
I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as
you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own
dress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the method,
or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to
me without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at
it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I
grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that
I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it
was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You
were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant
to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not
mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I
felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my
studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of
its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that
I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely
good - looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling
that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is
ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract
than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour — that is all.
It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely
than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I
determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.
It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were
right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me,
Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are
made to be worshipped.”"
174,9,44,"Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his cheeks, and
a smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the
time. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who
had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he
himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. Lord
Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all. He was
too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be
some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry? Was that one of
the things that life had in store?"
174,9,45,"“It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,” said Hallward, “that you should
have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?”"
174,9,46,"“I saw something in it,” he answered, “something that seemed to me very
curious.”"
174,9,47,"“Well, you don’t mind my looking at the thing now?”"
174,9,48,"Dorian shook his head. “You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not
possibly let you stand in front of that picture.”"
174,9,49,"“You will some day, surely?”"
174,9,50,“Never.”
174,9,51,"“Well, perhaps you are right. And now good - bye, Dorian. You have been
the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I
have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don’t know what it cost
me to tell you all that I have told you.”"
174,9,52,"“My dear Basil,” said Dorian, “what have you told me? Simply that you
felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a compliment.”"
174,9,53,"“It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I
have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one
should never put one’s worship into words.”"
174,9,54,“It was a very disappointing confession.”
174,9,55,"“Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn’t see anything else in the
picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?”"
174,9,56,"“No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn’t
talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we
must always remain so.”"
174,9,57,"“You have got Harry,” said the painter sadly."
174,9,58,"“Oh, Harry!” cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. “Harry spends
his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is
improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I
don’t think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go
to you, Basil.”"
174,9,59,“You will sit to me again?”
174,9,60,“Impossible!”
174,9,61,"“You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes
across two ideal things. Few come across one.”"
174,9,62,"“I can’t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.
There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I
will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.”"
174,9,63,"“Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,” murmured Hallward regretfully. “And
now good - bye. I am sorry you won’t let me look at the picture once
again. But that can’t be helped. I quite understand what you feel about
it.”"
174,9,64,"As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! How
little he knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that, instead
of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded,
almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend! How much that
strange confession explained to him! The painter’s absurd fits of
jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious
reticences — he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed
to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance."
174,9,65,"He sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all
costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad
of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room
to which any of his friends had access."
174,10,1,"When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if
he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite
impassive and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked
over to the glass and glanced into it. He could see the reflection of
Victor’s face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There
was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his
guard."
174,10,2,"Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house - keeper that he
wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame - maker and ask him to
send two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the man
left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. Or was
that merely his own fancy?"
174,10,3,"After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old - fashioned thread
mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He
asked her for the key of the schoolroom."
174,10,4,"“The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?” she exclaimed. “Why, it is full of
dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It
is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed.”"
174,10,5,"“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.”"
174,10,6,"“Well, sir, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why, it
hasn’t been opened for nearly five years — not since his lordship died.”"
174,10,7,"He winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories of
him. “That does not matter,” he answered. “I simply want to see the
place — that is all. Give me the key.”"
174,10,8,"“And here is the key, sir,” said the old lady, going over the contents
of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. “Here is the key. I’ll
have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don’t think of living up
there, sir, and you so comfortable here?”"
174,10,9,"“No, no,” he cried petulantly. “Thank you, Leaf. That will do.”"
174,10,10,"She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of
the household. He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought
best. She left the room, wreathed in smiles."
174,10,11,"As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round
the room. His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily
embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth - century
Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.
Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps
served often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that
had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death
itself — something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. What
the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on
the canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They
would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still
live on. It would be always alive."
174,10,12,"He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil
the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would
have helped him to resist Lord Henry’s influence, and the still more
poisonous influences that came from his own temperament. The love that
he bore him — for it was really love — had nothing in it that was not noble
and intellectual. It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty
that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire. It was
such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann,
and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was
too late now. The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or
forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable. There were
passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that
would make the shadow of their evil real."
174,10,13,"He took up from the couch the great purple - and - gold texture that
covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was
the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him that it was
unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold hair, blue
eyes, and rose - red lips — they all were there. It was simply the
expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared
to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil’s
reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been! — how shallow, and of what little
account! His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and
calling him to judgement. A look of pain came across him, and he flung
the rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock came to the door.
He passed out as his servant entered."
174,10,14,"“The persons are here, Monsieur.”"
174,10,15,"He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed
to know where the picture was being taken to. There was something sly
about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the
writing - table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him
round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at
eight - fifteen that evening."
174,10,16,"“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show the men in
here.”"
174,10,17,"In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard
himself, the celebrated frame - maker of South Audley Street, came in
with a somewhat rough - looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a
florid, red - whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was
considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the
artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He
waited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in
favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed
everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him."
174,10,18,"“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat freckled
hands. “I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in
person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a
sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited
for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.”"
174,10,19,"“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.
Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame — though I don’t
go in much at present for religious art — but to - day I only want a
picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so
I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”"
174,10,20,"“No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to
you. Which is the work of art, sir?”"
174,10,21,"“This,” replied Dorian, moving the screen back. “Can you move it,
covering and all, just as it is? I don’t want it to get scratched going
upstairs.”"
174,10,22,"“There will be no difficulty, sir,” said the genial frame - maker,
beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from
the long brass chains by which it was suspended. “And, now, where shall
we carry it to, Mr. Gray?”"
174,10,23,"“I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. Or
perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top
of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.”"
174,10,24,"He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and
began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the
picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious
protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman’s spirited dislike
of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it
so as to help them."
174,10,25,"“Something of a load to carry, sir,” gasped the little man when they
reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead."
174,10,26,"“I am afraid it is rather heavy,” murmured Dorian as he unlocked the
door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious
secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men."
174,10,27,"He had not entered the place for more than four years — not, indeed,
since he had used it first as a play - room when he was a child, and then
as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a large,
well - proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord
Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness
to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and
desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to have but little
changed. There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically
painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so
often hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book - case filled
with his dog - eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the
same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing
chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded
birds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every
moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round. He
recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed
horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden
away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in
store for him!"
174,10,28,"But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as
this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its
purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,
and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He himself would
not see it. Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? He
kept his youth — that was enough. And, besides, might not his nature grow
finer, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full
of shame. Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and
shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit
and in flesh — those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them
their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would
have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to
the world Basil Hallward’s masterpiece."
174,10,29,"No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon
the canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of sin, but
the hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would become
hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow’s feet would creep round the fading eyes
and make them horrible. The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth
would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old
men are. There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue - veined
hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the grandfather who had
been so stern to him in his boyhood. The picture had to be concealed.
There was no help for it."
174,10,30,"“Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,” he said, wearily, turning round. “I
am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something else.”"
174,10,31,"“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame - maker, who
was still gasping for breath. “Where shall we put it, sir?”"
174,10,32,"“Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don’t want to have it hung up.
Just lean it against the wall. Thanks.”"
174,10,33,"“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”"
174,10,34,"Dorian started. “It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,” he said,
keeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling
him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that
concealed the secret of his life. “I shan’t trouble you any more now. I
am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.”"
174,10,35,"“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you,
sir.” And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,
who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough
uncomely face. He had never seen any one so marvellous."
174,10,36,"When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door
and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look
upon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame."
174,10,37,"On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o’clock
and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark
perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley,
his guardian’s wife, a pretty professional invalid who had spent the
preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside
it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the
edges soiled. A copy of the third edition of _The St. James’s Gazette_
had been placed on the tea - tray. It was evident that Victor had
returned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were
leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.
He would be sure to miss the picture — had no doubt missed it already,
while he had been laying the tea - things. The screen had not been set
back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he
might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the
room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one’s house. He had
heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some
servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked
up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower
or a shred of crumpled lace."
174,10,38,"He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry’s
note. It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper,
and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at
eight - fifteen. He opened _The St. James’s_ languidly, and looked
through it. A red pencil - mark on the fifth page caught his eye. It drew
attention to the following paragraph:"
174,10,39,"INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS. — An inquest was held this morning at the Bell
Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of
Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,
Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Considerable
sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly
affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr.
Birrell, who had made the post - mortem examination of the deceased."
174,10,40,"He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and
flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real
ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for
having sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him to have
marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew more
than enough English for that."
174,10,41,"Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet,
what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane’s death?
There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her."
174,10,42,"His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What was
it, he wondered. He went towards the little, pearl - coloured octagonal
stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange
Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung
himself into an arm - chair and began to turn over the leaves. After a
few minutes he became absorbed. It was the strangest book that he had
ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the
delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb
show before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made
real to him. Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually
revealed."
174,10,43,"It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,
indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who
spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the
passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his
own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through
which the world - spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere
artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,
as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The
style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid
and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical
expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work
of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.
There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in
colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical
philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the
spiritual ecstasies of some mediæval saint or the morbid confessions of
a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense
seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere
cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full
as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,
produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter,
a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of
the falling day and creeping shadows."
174,10,44,"Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper - green sky gleamed
through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he could read no
more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the
lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed
the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his
bedside and began to dress for dinner."
174,10,45,"It was almost nine o’clock before he reached the club, where he found
Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning - room, looking very much bored."
174,10,46,"“I am so sorry, Harry,” he cried, “but really it is entirely your
fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the
time was going.”"
174,10,47,"“Yes, I thought you would like it,” replied his host, rising from his
chair."
174,10,48,"“I didn’t say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a
great difference.”"
174,10,49,"“Ah, you have discovered that?” murmured Lord Henry. And they passed
into the dining - room."
174,11,1,"For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of
this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never
sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than
nine large - paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in
different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the
changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have
almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in
whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely
blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And,
indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own
life, written before he had lived it."
174,11,2,"In one point he was more fortunate than the novel’s fantastic hero. He
never knew — never, indeed, had any cause to know — that somewhat grotesque
dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which
came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned
by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so
remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy — and perhaps in nearly every
joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place — that he used
to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if
somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who
had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly
valued."
174,11,3,"For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and
many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had
heard the most evil things against him — and from time to time strange
rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the
chatter of the clubs — could not believe anything to his dishonour when
they saw him. He had always the look of one who had kept himself
unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when
Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his
face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to them the
memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one
so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an
age that was at once sordid and sensual."
174,11,4,"Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged
absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were
his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep
upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left
him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil
Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on
the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him
from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to
quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his
own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.
He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and
terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead
or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which
were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would
place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,
and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs."
174,11,5,"There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own
delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little
ill - famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in
disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he
had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant
because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare.
That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as
they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase
with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He
had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them."
174,11,6,"Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to
society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each
Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the
world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the
day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. His little
dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were
noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,
as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with
its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered
cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many,
especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,
in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often
dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of
the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and
perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to be of
the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to “make
themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.” Like Gautier, he was one
for whom “the visible world existed.”"
174,11,7,"And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the
arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.
Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment
universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert
the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for
him. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to
time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of
the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in
everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of
his graceful, though to him only half - serious, fopperies."
174,11,8,"For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost
immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a
subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the
London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the
Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be
something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on
the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of
a cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have
its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the
spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization."
174,11,9,"The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been
decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and
sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are
conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.
But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had
never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal
merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or
to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a
new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the
dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through
history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been
surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful
rejections, monstrous forms of self - torture and self - denial, whose
origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more
terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,
they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out
the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to
the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions."
174,11,10,"Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that
was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism
that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was to have its
service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any
theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of
passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself,
and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of
the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy
that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man to
concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a
moment."
174,11,11,"There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either
after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of
death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through
the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality
itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques,
and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one
might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled
with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the
curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb
shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside,
there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men
going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down
from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it
feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from
her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by
degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we
watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan
mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we
had left them, and beside them lies the half - cut book that we had been
studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the
letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.
Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night
comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where
we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the
necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of
stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids
might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in
the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh
shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in
which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate,
in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of
joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain."
174,11,12,"It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray
to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his
search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and
possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he
would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really
alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and
then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his
intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that
is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that,
indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition
of it."
174,11,13,"It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman
Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great
attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the
sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb
rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity
of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it
sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement
and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with
white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft
the jewelled, lantern - shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at
times, one would fain think, is indeed the “_panis cælestis_,” the
bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ,
breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.
The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet,
tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle
fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at
the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of
them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating
the true story of their lives."
174,11,14,"But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual
development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of
mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable
for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which
there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its
marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle
antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a
season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of
the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in
tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the
brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of
the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,
morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him
before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance
compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all
intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.
He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual
mysteries to reveal."
174,11,15,"And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their
manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums
from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not
its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their
true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one
mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one’s passions, and in violets
that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the
brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often
to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several
influences of sweet - smelling roots and scented, pollen - laden flowers;
of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that
sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to
be able to expel melancholy from the soul."
174,11,16,"At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long
latticed room, with a vermilion - and - gold ceiling and walls of
olive - green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad
gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow - shawled
Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while
grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching
upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of
reed or brass and charmed — or feigned to charm — great hooded snakes and
horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of
barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert’s grace, and Chopin’s
beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell
unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the world
the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of
dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact
with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He had the
mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not
allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been
subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the
Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human
bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green
jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular
sweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when
they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the
performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the
harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who
sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a
distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating
tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an
elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_ - bells
of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge
cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the
one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican
temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a
description. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated
him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like
Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous
voices. Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his
box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt
pleasure to “Tannhauser” and seeing in the prelude to that great work
of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul."
174,11,17,"On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a
costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered
with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for
years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He would often
spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various
stones that he had collected, such as the olive - green chrysoberyl that
turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver,
the pistachio - coloured peridot, rose - pink and wine - yellow topazes,
carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four - rayed stars, flame - red
cinnamon - stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their
alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the
sunstone, and the moonstone’s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow
of the milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of
extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la
vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs."
174,11,18,"He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonso’s
Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real
jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of
Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes “with
collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.” There was a gem in
the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and “by the exhibition
of golden letters and a scarlet robe” the monster could be thrown into
a magical sleep and slain. According to the great alchemist, Pierre de
Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India
made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth
provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The
garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her
colour. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus,
that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.
Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a
newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The
bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm
that could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was the
aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any
danger by fire."
174,11,19,"The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand,
as the ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of John the
Priest were “made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake
inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.” Over the gable
were “two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,” so that the
gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night. In Lodge’s strange
romance ‘A Margarite of America’, it was stated that in the chamber of
the queen one could behold “all the chaste ladies of the world,
inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites,
carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.” Marco Polo had seen the
inhabitants of Zipangu place rose - coloured pearls in the mouths of the
dead. A sea - monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver
brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven
moons over its loss. When the Huns lured the king into the great pit,
he flung it away — Procopius tells the story — nor was it ever found again,
though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred - weight of gold
pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a
rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he
worshipped."
174,11,20,"When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII.
of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to
Brantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great
light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred
and twenty - one diamonds. Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty
thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall described
Henry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as
wearing “a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds
and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large
balasses.” The favourites of James I wore ear - rings of emeralds set in
gold filigrane. Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red - gold
armour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with
turquoise - stones, and a skull - cap _parsemé_ with pearls. Henry II. wore
jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk - glove sewn with
twelve rubies and fifty - two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles the
Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear - shaped
pearls and studded with sapphires."
174,11,21,"How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and
decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful."
174,11,22,"Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that
performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern
nations of Europe. As he investigated the subject — and he always had an
extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in
whatever he took up — he was almost saddened by the reflection of the
ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any
rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils
bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of
their shame, but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained
his flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things! Where
had they passed to? Where was the great crocus - coloured robe, on which
the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls
for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium that Nero had
stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on
which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot
drawn by white, gilt - reined steeds? He longed to see the curious
table - napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were
displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;
the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden
bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of
Pontus and were figured with “lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,
rocks, hunters — all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature”; and
the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which
were embroidered the verses of a song beginning “_Madame, je suis tout
joyeux_,” the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold
thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four
pearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims
for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with “thirteen
hundred and twenty - one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the
king’s arms, and five hundred and sixty - one butterflies, whose wings
were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked
in gold.” Catherine de Medicis had a mourning - bed made for her of black
velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask,
with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground,
and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in
a room hung with rows of the queen’s devices in cut black velvet upon
cloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen
feet high in his apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland,
was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses
from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased,
and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It had been
taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed
had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy."
174,11,23,"And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite
specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting
the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold - thread palmates and
stitched over with iridescent beetles’ wings; the Dacca gauzes, that
from their transparency are known in the East as “woven air,” and
“running water,” and “evening dew”; strange figured cloths from Java;
elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair
blue silks and wrought with _fleurs - de - lis_, birds and images; veils of
_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish
velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,
with their green - toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds."
174,11,24,"He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed
he had for everything connected with the service of the Church. In the
long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had
stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the
raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and
fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by
the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self - inflicted pain. He
possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold - thread damask,
figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in
six - petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the
pine - apple device wrought in seed - pearls. The orphreys were divided
into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the
coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.
This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of
green velvet, embroidered with heart - shaped groups of acanthus - leaves,
from which spread long - stemmed white blossoms, the details of which
were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse
bore a seraph’s head in gold - thread raised work. The orphreys were
woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with
medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He
had chasubles, also, of amber - coloured silk, and blue silk and gold
brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with
representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and
embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of
white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins
and _fleurs - de - lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen;
and many corporals, chalice - veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices
to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his
imagination."
174,11,25,"For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely
house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he
could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times
to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked
room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his
own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the
real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the
purple - and - gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there,
would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,
his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.
Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to
dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,
until he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the
picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times,
with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin,
and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to
bear the burden that should have been his own."
174,11,26,"After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and
gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as
well as the little white walled - in house at Algiers where they had more
than once spent the winter. He hated to be separated from the picture
that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his
absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the
elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door."
174,11,27,"He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true
that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness
of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn
from that? He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him. He had not
painted it. What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?
Even if he told them, would they believe it?"
174,11,28,"Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house in
Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank
who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton
luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly
leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not
been tampered with and that the picture was still there. What if it
should be stolen? The mere thought made him cold with horror. Surely
the world would know his secret then. Perhaps the world already
suspected it."
174,11,29,"For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.
He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth
and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was
said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the
smoking - room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another
gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories
became current about him after he had passed his twenty - fifth year. It
was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a
low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with
thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His
extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear
again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass
him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though
they were determined to discover his secret."
174,11,30,"Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,
and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his
charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth
that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer
to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about
him. It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most
intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Women who had
wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and
set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or
horror if Dorian Gray entered the room."
174,11,31,"Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his
strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of
security. Society — civilized society, at least — is never very ready to
believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and
fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance
than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much
less value than the possession of a good _chef_. And, after all, it is
a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad
dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the
cardinal virtues cannot atone for half - cold _entrées_, as Lord Henry
remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a
good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are,
or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely
essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as
its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic
play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is
insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method
by which we can multiply our personalities."
174,11,32,"Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion. He used to wonder at the
shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing
simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a
being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform
creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and
passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies
of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture - gallery
of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose
blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by
Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and
King James, as one who was “caressed by the Court for his handsome
face, which kept him not long company.” Was it young Herbert’s life
that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body
to body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that
ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,
give utterance, in Basil Hallward’s studio, to the mad prayer that had
so changed his life? Here, in gold - embroidered red doublet, jewelled
surcoat, and gilt - edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,
with his silver - and - black armour piled at his feet. What had this man’s
legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some
inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams
that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading
canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl
stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand,
and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On
a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green
rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the
strange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of
her temperament in him? These oval, heavy - lidded eyes seemed to look
curiously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and
fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and
swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.
Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so
overladen with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century,
and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord
Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and
one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How
proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!
What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as
infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the
Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his
wife, a pallid, thin - lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred
within him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady
Hamilton face and her moist, wine - dashed lips — he knew what he had got
from her. He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the
beauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.
There were vine leaves in her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she
was holding. The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes
were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour. They
seemed to follow him wherever he went."
174,11,33,"Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one’s own race,
nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly
with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There
were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history
was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act
and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it
had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known
them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the
stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of
subtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had
been his own."
174,11,34,"The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had
himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he tells how,
crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as
Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of
Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the
flute - player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had
caroused with the green - shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in
an ivory manger with a jewel - frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had
wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round
with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his
days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _tædium vitæ_, that comes
on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear
emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of
pearl and purple drawn by silver - shod mules, been carried through the
Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero
Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with
colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon
from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun."
174,11,35,"Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the
two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious
tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and
beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made
monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted
her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the
dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the
Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and
whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the
price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase
living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot
who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide
riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto;
Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and
minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery,
and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson
silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might
serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy
could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion
for red blood, as other men have for red wine — the son of the Fiend, as
was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling
with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the
name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads
was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of
Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the
enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave
poison to Ginevra d’Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a
shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles
VI., who had so wildly adored his brother’s wife that a leper had
warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his
brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen
cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in
his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto
Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page,
and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow
piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep,
and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him."
174,11,36,"There was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at night, and
they troubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of
strange manners of poisoning — poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch,
by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by
an amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book. There were
moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could
realize his conception of the beautiful."
174,12,1,"It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty - eighth
birthday, as he often remembered afterwards."
174,12,2,"He was walking home about eleven o’clock from Lord Henry’s, where he
had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold
and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a
man passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of
his grey ulster turned up. He had a bag in his hand. Dorian recognized
him. It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he could
not account, came over him. He made no sign of recognition and went on
quickly in the direction of his own house."
174,12,3,"But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the
pavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his hand was on
his arm."
174,12,4,"“Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for
you in your library ever since nine o’clock. Finally I took pity on
your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am
off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see
you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as
you passed me. But I wasn’t quite sure. Didn’t you recognize me?”"
174,12,5,"“In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor
Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don’t feel at
all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen
you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?”"
174,12,6,"“No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take a
studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture
I have in my head. However, it wasn’t about myself I wanted to talk.
Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something
to say to you.”"
174,12,7,"“I shall be charmed. But won’t you miss your train?” said Dorian Gray
languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his
latch - key."
174,12,8,"The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his
watch. “I have heaps of time,” he answered. “The train doesn’t go till
twelve - fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to
the club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shan’t have any
delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with
me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.”"
174,12,9,"Dorian looked at him and smiled. “What a way for a fashionable painter
to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get
into the house. And mind you don’t talk about anything serious. Nothing
is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be.”"
174,12,10,"Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the
library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.
The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit - case stood, with
some siphons of soda - water and large cut - glass tumblers, on a little
marqueterie table."
174,12,11,"“You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me
everything I wanted, including your best gold - tipped cigarettes. He is
a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman
you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?”"
174,12,12,"Dorian shrugged his shoulders. “I believe he married Lady Radley’s
maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.
_Anglomanie_ is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly
of the French, doesn’t it? But — do you know? — he was not at all a bad
servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One
often imagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted
to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another
brandy - and - soda? Or would you like hock - and - seltzer? I always take
hock - and - seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the next room.”"
174,12,13,"“Thanks, I won’t have anything more,” said the painter, taking his cap
and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the
corner. “And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.
Don’t frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.”"
174,12,14,"“What is it all about?” cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging
himself down on the sofa. “I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of
myself to - night. I should like to be somebody else.”"
174,12,15,"“It is about yourself,” answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, “and
I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour.”"
174,12,16,Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette. “Half an hour!” he murmured.
174,12,17,"“It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own
sake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know that the
most dreadful things are being said against you in London.”"
174,12,18,"“I don’t wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other
people, but scandals about myself don’t interest me. They have not got
the charm of novelty.”"
174,12,19,"“They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his
good name. You don’t want people to talk of you as something vile and
degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all
that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind
you, I don’t believe these rumours at all. At least, I can’t believe
them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man’s
face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices.
There are no such things. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself
in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of
his hands even. Somebody — I won’t mention his name, but you know
him — came to me last year to have his portrait done. I had never seen
him before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though
I have heard a good deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I
refused him. There was something in the shape of his fingers that I
hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.
His life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent
face, and your marvellous untroubled youth — I can’t believe anything
against you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to
the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these
hideous things that people are whispering about you, I don’t know what
to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves
the room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen
in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs? You
used to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him at dinner last week.
Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the
miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley. Staveley
curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes,
but that you were a man whom no pure - minded girl should be allowed to
know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I
reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.
He told me. He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why
is your friendship so fatal to young men? There was that wretched boy
in the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There
was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.
You and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and his
dreadful end? What about Lord Kent’s only son and his career? I met his
father yesterday in St. James’s Street. He seemed broken with shame and
sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he
got now? What gentleman would associate with him?”"
174,12,20,"“Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing,”
said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt
in his voice. “You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it. It
is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows
anything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how could
his record be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did
I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery? If Kent’s
silly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me? If
Adrian Singleton writes his friend’s name across a bill, am I his
keeper? I know how people chatter in England. The middle classes air
their moral prejudices over their gross dinner - tables, and whisper
about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try
and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with
the people they slander. In this country, it is enough for a man to
have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.
And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead
themselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land
of the hypocrite.”"
174,12,21,"“Dorian,” cried Hallward, “that is not the question. England is bad
enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why
I want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a right to judge
of a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all
sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a
madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them
there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are
smiling now. And there is worse behind. I know you and Harry are
inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not
have made his sister’s name a by - word.”"
174,12,22,"“Take care, Basil. You go too far.”"
174,12,23,"“I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady
Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a
single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?
Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her. Then there are
other stories — stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of
dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in
London. Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I
laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What about your
country - house and the life that is led there? Dorian, you don’t know
what is said about you. I won’t tell you that I don’t want to preach to
you. I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself
into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and
then proceeded to break his word. I do want to preach to you. I want
you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you
to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the
dreadful people you associate with. Don’t shrug your shoulders like
that. Don’t be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it
be for good, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every one with
whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to
enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after. I don’t know
whether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am
told things that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one
of my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife
had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.
Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read. I
told him that it was absurd — that I knew you thoroughly and that you
were incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know
you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.”"
174,12,24,"“To see my soul!” muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and
turning almost white from fear."
174,12,25,"“Yes,” answered Hallward gravely, and with deep - toned sorrow in his
voice, “to see your soul. But only God can do that.”"
174,12,26,"A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. “You
shall see it yourself, to - night!” he cried, seizing a lamp from the
table. “Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn’t you look at it?
You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody
would believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me all the
better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate
about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough
about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face.”"
174,12,27,"There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his
foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible
joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that
the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his
shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous
memory of what he had done."
174,12,28,"“Yes,” he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into
his stern eyes, “I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing that
you fancy only God can see.”"
174,12,29,"Hallward started back. “This is blasphemy, Dorian!” he cried. “You must
not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don’t mean
anything.”"
174,12,30,“You think so?” He laughed again.
174,12,31,"“I know so. As for what I said to you to - night, I said it for your
good. You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.”"
174,12,32,“Don’t touch me. Finish what you have to say.”
174,12,33,"A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter’s face. He paused for a
moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right
had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of
what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he
straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire - place, and stood
there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their
throbbing cores of flame."
174,12,34,"“I am waiting, Basil,” said the young man in a hard clear voice."
174,12,35,"He turned round. “What I have to say is this,” he cried. “You must give
me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you. If
you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I
shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can’t you see what I
am going through? My God! don’t tell me that you are bad, and corrupt,
and shameful.”"
174,12,36,"Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. “Come
upstairs, Basil,” he said quietly. “I keep a diary of my life from day
to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall
show it to you if you come with me.”"
174,12,37,"“I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my
train. That makes no matter. I can go to - morrow. But don’t ask me to
read anything to - night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.”"
174,12,38,"“That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You
will not have to read long.”"
174,13,1,"He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward
following close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at
night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A
rising wind made some of the windows rattle."
174,13,2,"When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the
floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock. “You insist on
knowing, Basil?” he asked in a low voice."
174,13,3,“Yes.”
174,13,4,"“I am delighted,” he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat
harshly, “You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know
everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you
think”; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold
current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a
flame of murky orange. He shuddered. “Shut the door behind you,” he
whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table."
174,13,5,"Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked
as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a
curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty
book - case — that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a
table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half - burned candle that was
standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered
with dust and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling
behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew."
174,13,6,"“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that
curtain back, and you will see mine.”"
174,13,7,"The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. “You are mad, Dorian, or
playing a part,” muttered Hallward, frowning."
174,13,8,"“You won’t? Then I must do it myself,” said the young man, and he tore
the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground."
174,13,9,"An exclamation of horror broke from the painter’s lips as he saw in the
dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was
something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.
Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray’s own face that he was looking at! The
horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous
beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet
on the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes had kept something of the
loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely
passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it
was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own
brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous,
yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the
picture. In the left - hand corner was his own name, traced in long
letters of bright vermilion."
174,13,10,"It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had never
done that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as if
his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His own
picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He turned and looked at
Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His mouth twitched, and his
parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He passed his hand across
his forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat."
174,13,11,"The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with
that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are
absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither
real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the
spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had taken
the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do
so."
174,13,12,"“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded
shrill and curious in his ears."
174,13,13,"“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in
his hand, “you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my
good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who
explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me
that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even
now, I don’t know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you
would call it a prayer....”"
174,13,14,"“I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is
impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The
paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the
thing is impossible.”"
174,13,15,"“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the
window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist - stained glass."
174,13,16,“You told me you had destroyed it.”
174,13,17,“I was wrong. It has destroyed me.”
174,13,18,“I don’t believe it is my picture.”
174,13,19,“Can’t you see your ideal in it?” said Dorian bitterly.
174,13,20,"“My ideal, as you call it...”"
174,13,21,“As you called it.”
174,13,22,"“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an
ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.”"
174,13,23,“It is the face of my soul.”
174,13,24,"“Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a
devil.”"
174,13,25,"“Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian with a
wild gesture of despair."
174,13,26,"Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. “My God! If it
is true,” he exclaimed, “and this is what you have done with your life,
why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you
to be!” He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it. The
surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it. It was
from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through
some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly
eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was
not so fearful."
174,13,27,"His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and
lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out. Then he
flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and
buried his face in his hands."
174,13,28,"“Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!” There was no
answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. “Pray,
Dorian, pray,” he murmured. “What is it that one was taught to say in
one’s boyhood? ‘Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our sins. Wash
away our iniquities.’ Let us say that together. The prayer of your
pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be answered
also. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped
yourself too much. We are both punished.”"
174,13,29,"Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear - dimmed
eyes. “It is too late, Basil,” he faltered."
174,13,30,"“It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot
remember a prayer. Isn’t there a verse somewhere, ‘Though your sins be
as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow’?”"
174,13,31,“Those words mean nothing to me now.”
174,13,32,"“Hush! Don’t say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My God!
Don’t you see that accursed thing leering at us?”"
174,13,33,"Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable
feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had
been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his
ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred
within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more
than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. He glanced wildly
around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced
him. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It was a knife that he
had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had
forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing
Hallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and
turned round. Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.
He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind
the ear, crushing the man’s head down on the table and stabbing again
and again."
174,13,34,"There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking
with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,
waving grotesque, stiff - fingered hands in the air. He stabbed him twice
more, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on the
floor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. Then he
threw the knife on the table, and listened."
174,13,35,"He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He
opened the door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely
quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he stood bending over the
balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.
Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in
as he did so."
174,13,36,"The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with
bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been
for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was
slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was
simply asleep."
174,13,37,"How quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and walking
over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The wind
had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock’s
tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He looked down and saw the
policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on
the doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom
gleamed at the corner and then vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl
was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went. Now and
then she stopped and peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse
voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She
stumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The
gas - lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their
black iron branches to and fro. He shivered and went back, closing the
window behind him."
174,13,38,"Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. He did not
even glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the whole
thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had painted the
fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his
life. That was enough."
174,13,39,"Then he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish
workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished
steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it might be missed
by his servant, and questions would be asked. He hesitated for a
moment, then he turned back and took it from the table. He could not
help seeing the dead thing. How still it was! How horribly white the
long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax image."
174,13,40,"Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs. The
woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He stopped
several times and waited. No: everything was still. It was merely the
sound of his own footsteps."
174,13,41,"When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.
They must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was
in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises,
and put them into it. He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he
pulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to two."
174,13,42,"He sat down and began to think. Every year — every month, almost — men were
strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of
murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the earth....
And yet, what evidence was there against him? Basil Hallward had left
the house at eleven. No one had seen him come in again. Most of the
servants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone to bed.... Paris! Yes.
It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he
had intended. With his curious reserved habits, it would be months
before any suspicions would be roused. Months! Everything could be
destroyed long before then."
174,13,43,"A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and went
out into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the
policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the
bull’s - eye reflected in the window. He waited and held his breath."
174,13,44,"After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting
the door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In
about five minutes his valet appeared, half - dressed and looking very
drowsy."
174,13,45,"“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping in;
“but I had forgotten my latch - key. What time is it?”"
174,13,46,"“Ten minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock and
blinking."
174,13,47,"“Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine
to - morrow. I have some work to do.”"
174,13,48,"“All right, sir.”"
174,13,49,“Did any one call this evening?”
174,13,50,"“Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away
to catch his train.”"
174,13,51,“Oh! I am sorry I didn’t see him. Did he leave any message?”
174,13,52,"“No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not
find you at the club.”"
174,13,53,"“That will do, Francis. Don’t forget to call me at nine to - morrow.”"
174,13,54,"“No, sir.”"
174,13,55,The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.
174,13,56,"Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the
library. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room,
biting his lip and thinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one
of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves. “Alan Campbell, 152,
Hertford Street, Mayfair.” Yes; that was the man he wanted."
174,14,1,"At nine o’clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of
chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite
peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his
cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study."
174,14,2,"The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as
he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he
had been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all.
His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But
youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms."
174,14,3,"He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his
chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. The
sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was almost
like a morning in May."
174,14,4,"Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,
blood - stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there
with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had
suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for
Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came
back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still
sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was!
Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day."
174,14,5,"He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken
or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory
than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride
more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of
joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the
senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out
of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might
strangle one itself."
174,14,6,"When the half - hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and
then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual
care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and
scarf - pin and changing his rings more than once. He spent a long time
also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet
about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the
servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence. At some of the
letters, he smiled. Three of them bored him. One he read several times
over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.
“That awful thing, a woman’s memory!” as Lord Henry had once said."
174,14,7,"After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly
with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the
table, sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the
other he handed to the valet."
174,14,8,"“Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell
is out of town, get his address.”"
174,14,9,"As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a
piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and
then human faces. Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew
seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward. He frowned, and
getting up, went over to the book - case and took out a volume at hazard.
He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until
it became absolutely necessary that he should do so."
174,14,10,"When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title - page
of the book. It was Gautier’s “Émaux et Camées”, Charpentier’s
Japanese - paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was of
citron - green leather, with a design of gilt trellis - work and dotted
pomegranates. It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton. As he
turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of
Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand “_du supplice encore mal lavée_,” with
its downy red hairs and its “_doigts de faune_.” He glanced at his own
white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and
passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:"
174,14,11,"Sur une gamme chromatique,
Le sein de perles ruisselant,
La Vénus de l’Adriatique
Sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc."
174,14,12,"Les dômes, sur l’azur des ondes
Suivant la phrase au pur contour,
S’enflent comme des gorges rondes
Que soulève un soupir d’amour."
174,14,13,"L’esquif aborde et me dépose,
Jetant son amarre au pilier,
Devant une façade rose,
Sur le marbre d’un escalier."
174,14,14,"How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating
down the green water - ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black
gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked
to him like those straight lines of turquoise - blue that follow one as
one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour reminded him
of the gleam of the opal - and - iris - throated birds that flutter round the
tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through
the dim, dust - stained arcades. Leaning back with half - closed eyes, he
kept saying over and over to himself:"
174,14,15,"“Devant une façade rose,
Sur le marbre d’un escalier.”"
174,14,16,"The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn
that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to
mad delightful follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice,
like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true
romantic, background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had
been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor
Basil! What a horrible way for a man to die!"
174,14,17,"He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He read
of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _café_ at Smyrna
where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned
merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each
other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps
tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by
the hot, lotus - covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose - red
ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small
beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood
over those verses which, drawing music from kiss - stained marble, tell
of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the
“_monstre charmant_” that couches in the porphyry - room of the Louvre.
But after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a
horrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be
out of England? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he
might refuse to come. What could he do then? Every moment was of vital
importance."
174,14,18,"They had been great friends once, five years before — almost inseparable,
indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in
society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never
did."
174,14,19,"He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real
appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the
beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His
dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had
spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken
a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year. Indeed, he was
still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his
own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the
annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for
Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up
prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and
played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In
fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray
together — music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be
able to exercise whenever he wished — and, indeed, exercised often
without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire’s the
night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always
seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For
eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at
Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian
Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in
life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever
knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they
met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at
which Dorian Gray was present. He had changed, too — was strangely
melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and
would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called
upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in
which to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to
become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice
in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious
experiments."
174,14,20,"This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept
glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly
agitated. At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room,
looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long stealthy strides.
His hands were curiously cold."
174,14,21,"The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with
feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the
jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He knew what was waiting
for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands
his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight
and driven the eyeballs back into their cave. It was useless. The brain
had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made
grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,
danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving
masks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind,
slow - breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being
dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its
grave, and showed it to him. He stared at it. Its very horror made him
stone."
174,14,22,"At last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned glazed eyes
upon him."
174,14,23,"“Mr. Campbell, sir,” said the man."
174,14,24,"A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back
to his cheeks."
174,14,25,"“Ask him to come in at once, Francis.” He felt that he was himself
again. His mood of cowardice had passed away."
174,14,26,"The man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,
looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his
coal - black hair and dark eyebrows."
174,14,27,“Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming.”
174,14,28,"“I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it
was a matter of life and death.” His voice was hard and cold. He spoke
with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady
searching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his hands in the
pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the
gesture with which he had been greeted."
174,14,29,"“Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one
person. Sit down.”"
174,14,30,"Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The
two men’s eyes met. In Dorian’s there was infinite pity. He knew that
what he was going to do was dreadful."
174,14,31,"After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very
quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he
had sent for, “Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room
to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.
He has been dead ten hours now. Don’t stir, and don’t look at me like
that. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not
concern you. What you have to do is this — ”"
174,14,32,"“Stop, Gray. I don’t want to know anything further. Whether what you
have told me is true or not true doesn’t concern me. I entirely decline
to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.
They don’t interest me any more.”"
174,14,33,"“Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest
you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can’t help myself. You are
the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the
matter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know about
chemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments. What you
have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs — to destroy it
so that not a vestige of it will be left. Nobody saw this person come
into the house. Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in
Paris. He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must
be no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change him, and
everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may
scatter in the air.”"
174,14,34,"“You are mad, Dorian.”"
174,14,35,“Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.”
174,14,36,"“You are mad, I tell you — mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to
help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to
do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril
my reputation for you? What is it to me what devil’s work you are up
to?”"
174,14,37,"“It was suicide, Alan.”"
174,14,38,"“I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy.”"
174,14,39,“Do you still refuse to do this for me?”
174,14,40,"“Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I
don’t care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not be
sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of
all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have
thought you knew more about people’s characters. Your friend Lord Henry
Wotton can’t have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he
has taught you. Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You
have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don’t come to
me.”"
174,14,41,"“Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don’t know what he had made me
suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the
marring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not have intended it, the
result was the same.”"
174,14,42,"“Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not
inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring in
the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a crime
without doing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do with it.”"
174,14,43,"“You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to
me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain
scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead - houses, and the
horrors that you do there don’t affect you. If in some hideous
dissecting - room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a
leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow
through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject. You
would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing
anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were
benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the
world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.
What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.
Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are
accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence
against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be
discovered unless you help me.”"
174,14,44,"“I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply indifferent
to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.”"
174,14,45,"“Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you
came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some
day. No! don’t think of that. Look at the matter purely from the
scientific point of view. You don’t inquire where the dead things on
which you experiment come from. Don’t inquire now. I have told you too
much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once,
Alan.”"
174,14,46,"“Don’t speak about those days, Dorian — they are dead.”"
174,14,47,"“The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is
sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan! Alan!
If you don’t come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will hang
me, Alan! Don’t you understand? They will hang me for what I have
done.”"
174,14,48,"“There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do
anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me.”"
174,14,49,“You refuse?”
174,14,50,“Yes.”
174,14,51,"“I entreat you, Alan.”"
174,14,52,“It is useless.”
174,14,53,"The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray’s eyes. Then he stretched
out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He read
it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.
Having done this, he got up and went over to the window."
174,14,54,"Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and
opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back
in his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him. He felt as if
his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow."
174,14,55,"After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and
came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder."
174,14,56,"“I am so sorry for you, Alan,” he murmured, “but you leave me no
alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the
address. If you don’t help me, I must send it. If you don’t help me, I
will send it. You know what the result will be. But you are going to
help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you.
You will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern, harsh,
offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me — no
living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate
terms.”"
174,14,57,"Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through
him."
174,14,58,"“Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The
thing is quite simple. Come, don’t work yourself into this fever. The
thing has to be done. Face it, and do it.”"
174,14,59,"A groan broke from Campbell’s lips and he shivered all over. The
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing
time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be
borne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his
forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already
come upon him. The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead.
It was intolerable. It seemed to crush him."
174,14,60,"“Come, Alan, you must decide at once.”"
174,14,61,"“I cannot do it,” he said, mechanically, as though words could alter
things."
174,14,62,“You must. You have no choice. Don’t delay.”
174,14,63,He hesitated a moment. “Is there a fire in the room upstairs?”
174,14,64,"“Yes, there is a gas - fire with asbestos.”"
174,14,65,“I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.”
174,14,66,"“No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of
notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the
things back to you.”"
174,14,67,"Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope
to his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully. Then
he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as
soon as possible and to bring the things with him."
174,14,68,"As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up
from the chair, went over to the chimney - piece. He was shivering with a
kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A
fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was
like the beat of a hammer."
174,14,69,"As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian
Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was something in
the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him.
“You are infamous, absolutely infamous!” he muttered."
174,14,70,"“Hush, Alan. You have saved my life,” said Dorian."
174,14,71,"“Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from
corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime. In
doing what I am going to do — what you force me to do — it is not of your
life that I am thinking.”"
174,14,72,"“Ah, Alan,” murmured Dorian with a sigh, “I wish you had a thousandth
part of the pity for me that I have for you.” He turned away as he
spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer."
174,14,73,"After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant
entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil
of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps."
174,14,74,"“Shall I leave the things here, sir?” he asked Campbell."
174,14,75,"“Yes,” said Dorian. “And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another
errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies
Selby with orchids?”"
174,14,76,"“Harden, sir.”"
174,14,77,"“Yes — Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden
personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,
and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I don’t want any
white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty
place — otherwise I wouldn’t bother you about it.”"
174,14,78,"“No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?”"
174,14,79,"Dorian looked at Campbell. “How long will your experiment take, Alan?”
he said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third person in
the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage."
174,14,80,"Campbell frowned and bit his lip. “It will take about five hours,” he
answered."
174,14,81,"“It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half - past seven,
Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have
the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want
you.”"
174,14,82,"“Thank you, sir,” said the man, leaving the room."
174,14,83,"“Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!
I’ll take it for you. You bring the other things.” He spoke rapidly and
in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him. They left
the room together."
174,14,84,"When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned
it in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his
eyes. He shuddered. “I don’t think I can go in, Alan,” he murmured."
174,14,85,"“It is nothing to me. I don’t require you,” said Campbell coldly."
174,14,86,"Dorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of his
portrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn
curtain was lying. He remembered that the night before he had
forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,
and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder."
174,14,87,"What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on
one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible
it was! — more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent
thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose
grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had
not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it."
174,14,88,"He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with
half - closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that
he would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down and
taking up the gold - and - purple hanging, he flung it right over the
picture."
174,14,89,"There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed
themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard
Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other
things that he had required for his dreadful work. He began to wonder
if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had
thought of each other."
174,14,90,"“Leave me now,” said a stern voice behind him."
174,14,91,"He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been
thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a
glistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs, he heard the key
being turned in the lock."
174,14,92,"It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He
was pale, but absolutely calm. “I have done what you asked me to do,”
he muttered. “And now, good - bye. Let us never see each other again.”"
174,14,93,"“You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,” said Dorian
simply."
174,14,94,"As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a horrible
smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting
at the table was gone."
174,15,1,"That evening, at eight - thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large
button - hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady
Narborough’s drawing - room by bowing servants. His forehead was
throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his
manner as he bent over his hostess’s hand was as easy and graceful as
ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to
play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could
have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any
tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have
clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God
and goodness. He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his
demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a
double life."
174,15,2,"It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who
was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the
remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife
to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband
properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and
married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted
herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and
French _esprit_ when she could get it."
174,15,3,"Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that
she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life. “I know, my
dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,” she used to say,
“and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake. It is most
fortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it was, our
bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to
raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.
However, that was all Narborough’s fault. He was dreadfully
short - sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who
never sees anything.”"
174,15,4,"Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she
explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married
daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make
matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her. “I think it
is most unkind of her, my dear,” she whispered. “Of course I go and
stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old
woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake
them up. You don’t know what an existence they lead down there. It is
pure unadulterated country life. They get up early, because they have
so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to
think about. There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since
the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep
after dinner. You shan’t sit next either of them. You shall sit by me
and amuse me.”"
174,15,5,"Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes:
it was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had never seen
before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those
middle - aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,
but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an
overdressed woman of forty - seven, with a hooked nose, who was always
trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to
her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against
her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and
Venetian - red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess’s daughter, a dowdy
dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once
seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red - cheeked,
white - whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the
impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of
ideas."
174,15,6,"He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the
great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the
mauve - draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: “How horrid of Henry Wotton to be
so late! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised
faithfully not to disappoint me.”"
174,15,7,"It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door
opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some
insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored."
174,15,8,"But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away
untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called “an
insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,” and
now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence
and abstracted manner. From time to time the butler filled his glass
with champagne. He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase."
174,15,9,"“Dorian,” said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud - froid_ was being
handed round, “what is the matter with you to - night? You are quite out
of sorts.”"
174,15,10,"“I believe he is in love,” cried Lady Narborough, “and that he is
afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I
certainly should.”"
174,15,11,"“Dear Lady Narborough,” murmured Dorian, smiling, “I have not been in
love for a whole week — not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.”"
174,15,12,"“How you men can fall in love with that woman!” exclaimed the old lady.
“I really cannot understand it.”"
174,15,13,"“It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl,
Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry. “She is the one link between us and
your short frocks.”"
174,15,14,"“She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I
remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _décolletée_
she was then.”"
174,15,15,"“She is still _décolletée_,” he answered, taking an olive in his long
fingers; “and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an
_édition de luxe_ of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful, and
full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.
When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.”"
174,15,16,"“How can you, Harry!” cried Dorian."
174,15,17,"“It is a most romantic explanation,” laughed the hostess. “But her
third husband, Lord Henry! You don’t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?”"
174,15,18,"“Certainly, Lady Narborough.”"
174,15,19,“I don’t believe a word of it.”
174,15,20,"“Well, ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her most intimate friends.”"
174,15,21,"“Is it true, Mr. Gray?”"
174,15,22,"“She assures me so, Lady Narborough,” said Dorian. “I asked her
whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and
hung at her girdle. She told me she didn’t, because none of them had
had any hearts at all.”"
174,15,23,“Four husbands! Upon my word that is _trop de zêle_.”
174,15,24,"“_Trop d’audace_, I tell her,” said Dorian."
174,15,25,"“Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol
like? I don’t know him.”"
174,15,26,"“The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,”
said Lord Henry, sipping his wine."
174,15,27,"Lady Narborough hit him with her fan. “Lord Henry, I am not at all
surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.”"
174,15,28,"“But what world says that?” asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows.
“It can only be the next world. This world and I are on excellent
terms.”"
174,15,29,"“Everybody I know says you are very wicked,” cried the old lady,
shaking her head."
174,15,30,"Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. “It is perfectly
monstrous,” he said, at last, “the way people go about nowadays saying
things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely
true.”"
174,15,31,"“Isn’t he incorrigible?” cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair."
174,15,32,"“I hope so,” said his hostess, laughing. “But really, if you all
worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry
again so as to be in the fashion.”"
174,15,33,"“You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,” broke in Lord Henry.
“You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is because she
detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he
adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.”"
174,15,34,"“Narborough wasn’t perfect,” cried the old lady."
174,15,35,"“If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,” was the
rejoinder. “Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them,
they will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will never
ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough,
but it is quite true.”"
174,15,36,"“Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for
your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be
married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however,
that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married men live like
bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.”"
174,15,37,"“_Fin de siêcle_,” murmured Lord Henry."
174,15,38,"“_Fin du globe_,” answered his hostess."
174,15,39,"“I wish it were _fin du globe_,” said Dorian with a sigh. “Life is a
great disappointment.”"
174,15,40,"“Ah, my dear,” cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves, “don’t
tell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that one knows
that life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes
wish that I had been; but you are made to be good — you look so good. I
must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don’t you think that Mr. Gray
should get married?”"
174,15,41,"“I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry with a
bow."
174,15,42,"“Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him. I shall go
through Debrett carefully to - night and draw out a list of all the
eligible young ladies.”"
174,15,43,"“With their ages, Lady Narborough?” asked Dorian."
174,15,44,"“Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done
in a hurry. I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable
alliance, and I want you both to be happy.”"
174,15,45,"“What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!” exclaimed Lord
Henry. “A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love
her.”"
174,15,46,"“Ah! what a cynic you are!” cried the old lady, pushing back her chair
and nodding to Lady Ruxton. “You must come and dine with me soon again.
You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew
prescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would like to meet,
though. I want it to be a delightful gathering.”"
174,15,47,"“I like men who have a future and women who have a past,” he answered.
“Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?”"
174,15,48,"“I fear so,” she said, laughing, as she stood up. “A thousand pardons,
my dear Lady Ruxton,” she added, “I didn’t see you hadn’t finished your
cigarette.”"
174,15,49,"“Never mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I am going
to limit myself, for the future.”"
174,15,50,"“Pray don’t, Lady Ruxton,” said Lord Henry. “Moderation is a fatal
thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a
feast.”"
174,15,51,"Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. “You must come and explain that
to me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,” she
murmured, as she swept out of the room."
174,15,52,"“Now, mind you don’t stay too long over your politics and scandal,”
cried Lady Narborough from the door. “If you do, we are sure to
squabble upstairs.”"
174,15,53,"The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the
table and came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and
sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the
situation in the House of Commons. He guffawed at his adversaries. The
word _doctrinaire_ — word full of terror to the British mind — reappeared
from time to time between his explosions. An alliterative prefix served
as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles
of thought. The inherited stupidity of the race — sound English common
sense he jovially termed it — was shown to be the proper bulwark for
society."
174,15,54,"A smile curved Lord Henry’s lips, and he turned round and looked at
Dorian."
174,15,55,"“Are you better, my dear fellow?” he asked. “You seemed rather out of
sorts at dinner.”"
174,15,56,"“I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all.”"
174,15,57,"“You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to
you. She tells me she is going down to Selby.”"
174,15,58,“She has promised to come on the twentieth.”
174,15,59,"“Is Monmouth to be there, too?”"
174,15,60,"“Oh, yes, Harry.”"
174,15,61,"“He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very
clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of
weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image
precious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.
White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire, and
what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had experiences.”"
174,15,62,“How long has she been married?” asked Dorian.
174,15,63,"“An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is
ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity,
with time thrown in. Who else is coming?”"
174,15,64,"“Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey
Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.”"
174,15,65,"“I like him,” said Lord Henry. “A great many people don’t, but I find
him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by
being always absolutely over - educated. He is a very modern type.”"
174,15,66,"“I don’t know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go to
Monte Carlo with his father.”"
174,15,67,"“Ah! what a nuisance people’s people are! Try and make him come. By the
way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before eleven.
What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?”"
174,15,68,Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.
174,15,69,"“No, Harry,” he said at last, “I did not get home till nearly three.”"
174,15,70,“Did you go to the club?”
174,15,71,"“Yes,” he answered. Then he bit his lip. “No, I don’t mean that. I
didn’t go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I did.... How
inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has been
doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at
half - past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my
latch - key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any
corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him.”"
174,15,72,"Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let
us go up to the drawing - room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.
Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not
yourself to - night.”"
174,15,73,"“Don’t mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall come
round and see you to - morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady
Narborough. I shan’t go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home.”"
174,15,74,"“All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to - morrow at tea - time.
The duchess is coming.”"
174,15,75,"“I will try to be there, Harry,” he said, leaving the room. As he drove
back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he
thought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord Henry’s casual
questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted
his nerve still. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He
winced. He hated the idea of even touching them."
174,15,76,"Yet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked the
door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had
thrust Basil Hallward’s coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing. He piled
another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning
leather was horrible. It took him three - quarters of an hour to consume
everything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some
Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and
forehead with a cool musk - scented vinegar."
174,15,77,"Suddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed
nervously at his underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large
Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue
lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and
make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet
almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving came over him. He
lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped till the
long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. But he still watched the
cabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying,
went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A
triangular drawer passed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively
towards it, dipped in, and closed on something. It was a small Chinese
box of black and gold - dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides
patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round
crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside
was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and
persistent."
174,15,78,"He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his
face. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly
hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes
to twelve. He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did
so, and went into his bedroom."
174,15,79,"As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,
dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept
quietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good
horse. He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address."
174,15,80,"The man shook his head. “It is too far for me,” he muttered."
174,15,81,"“Here is a sovereign for you,” said Dorian. “You shall have another if
you drive fast.”"
174,15,82,"“All right, sir,” answered the man, “you will be there in an hour,” and
after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly
towards the river."
174,16,1,"A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street - lamps looked ghastly
in the dripping mist. The public - houses were just closing, and dim men
and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors. From some
of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards
brawled and screamed."
174,16,2,"Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian
Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and
now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said
to him on the first day they had met, “To cure the soul by means of the
senses, and the senses by means of the soul.” Yes, that was the secret.
He had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were opium
dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of
old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new."
174,16,3,"The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a
huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The
gas - lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the
man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from
the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The sidewindows of the hansom
were clogged with a grey - flannel mist."
174,16,4,"“To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of
the soul!” How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was
sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent
blood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there
was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness
was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing
out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.
Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done? Who
had made him a judge over others? He had said things that were
dreadful, horrible, not to be endured."
174,16,5,"On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each
step. He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The
hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and
his delicate hands twitched nervously together. He struck at the horse
madly with his stick. The driver laughed and whipped up. He laughed in
answer, and the man was silent."
174,16,6,"The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some
sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist
thickened, he felt afraid."
174,16,7,"Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and
he could see the strange, bottle - shaped kilns with their orange,
fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away in
the darkness some wandering sea - gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a
rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop."
174,16,8,"After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over
rough - paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then
fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind. He
watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes and made
gestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was in his heart.
As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open
door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards. The
driver beat at them with his whip."
174,16,9,"It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with
hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped
those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in
them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by
intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would
still have dominated his temper. From cell to cell of his brain crept
the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all
man’s appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.
Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,
became dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one
reality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of
disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more
vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious
shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song. They were what he needed for
forgetfulness. In three days he would be free."
174,16,10,"Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over
the low roofs and jagged chimney - stacks of the houses rose the black
masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the
yards."
174,16,11,"“Somewhere about here, sir, ain’t it?” he asked huskily through the
trap."
174,16,12,"Dorian started and peered round. “This will do,” he answered, and
having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had
promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here and
there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The
light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an
outward - bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like
a wet mackintosh."
174,16,13,"He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he
was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small
shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of
the top - windows stood a lamp. He stopped and gave a peculiar knock."
174,16,14,"After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being
unhooked. The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word
to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as
he passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that
swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the
street. He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as
if it had once been a third - rate dancing - saloon. Shrill flaring
gas - jets, dulled and distorted in the fly - blown mirrors that faced
them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin
backed them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered
with ochre - coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and
stained with dark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were crouching
by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing
their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his head
buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily
painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women,
mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an
expression of disgust. “He thinks he’s got red ants on him,” laughed
one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in terror and
began to whimper."
174,16,15,"At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a
darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the
heavy odour of opium met him. He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils
quivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow
hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up
at him and nodded in a hesitating manner."
174,16,16,"“You here, Adrian?” muttered Dorian."
174,16,17,"“Where else should I be?” he answered, listlessly. “None of the chaps
will speak to me now.”"
174,16,18,“I thought you had left England.”
174,16,19,"“Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at
last. George doesn’t speak to me either.... I don’t care,” he added
with a sigh. “As long as one has this stuff, one doesn’t want friends.
I think I have had too many friends.”"
174,16,20,"Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such
fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the
gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in
what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were
teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better off than he
was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was
eating his soul away. From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of
Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could not stay. The
presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted to be where no one
would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself."
174,16,21,"“I am going on to the other place,” he said after a pause."
174,16,22,“On the wharf?”
174,16,23,“Yes.”
174,16,24,"“That mad - cat is sure to be there. They won’t have her in this place
now.”"
174,16,25,"Dorian shrugged his shoulders. “I am sick of women who love one. Women
who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better.”"
174,16,26,“Much the same.”
174,16,27,"“I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have
something.”"
174,16,28,"“I don’t want anything,” murmured the young man."
174,16,29,“Never mind.”
174,16,30,"Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. A
half - caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous
greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of
them. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian turned his back
on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton."
174,16,31,"A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of
the women. “We are very proud to - night,” she sneered."
174,16,32,"“For God’s sake don’t talk to me,” cried Dorian, stamping his foot on
the ground. “What do you want? Money? Here it is. Don’t ever talk to me
again.”"
174,16,33,"Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman’s sodden eyes, then
flickered out and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her head and
raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her companion
watched her enviously."
174,16,34,"“It’s no use,” sighed Adrian Singleton. “I don’t care to go back. What
does it matter? I am quite happy here.”"
174,16,35,"“You will write to me if you want anything, won’t you?” said Dorian,
after a pause."
174,16,36,“Perhaps.”
174,16,37,"“Good night, then.”"
174,16,38,"“Good night,” answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping
his parched mouth with a handkerchief."
174,16,39,"Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he drew
the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the
woman who had taken his money. “There goes the devil’s bargain!” she
hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice."
174,16,40,"“Curse you!” he answered, “don’t call me that.”"
174,16,41,"She snapped her fingers. “Prince Charming is what you like to be
called, ain’t it?” she yelled after him."
174,16,42,"The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly
round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear. He
rushed out as if in pursuit."
174,16,43,"Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His
meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered
if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as
Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult. He bit his
lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad. Yet, after all, what did
it matter to him? One’s days were too brief to take the burden of
another’s errors on one’s shoulders. Each man lived his own life and
paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so
often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed.
In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts."
174,16,44,"There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or
for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of
the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful
impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.
They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken
from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all,
lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.
For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of
disobedience. When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell
from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell."
174,16,45,"Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for
rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but
as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a
short cut to the ill - famed place where he was going, he felt himself
suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself,
he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his
throat."
174,16,46,"He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the
tightening fingers away. In a second he heard the click of a revolver,
and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head,
and the dusky form of a short, thick - set man facing him."
174,16,47,“What do you want?” he gasped.
174,16,48,"“Keep quiet,” said the man. “If you stir, I shoot you.”"
174,16,49,“You are mad. What have I done to you?”
174,16,50,"“You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,” was the answer, “and Sibyl Vane
was my sister. She killed herself. I know it. Her death is at your
door. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought you.
I had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have described you
were dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you.
I heard it to - night by chance. Make your peace with God, for to - night
you are going to die.”"
174,16,51,"Dorian Gray grew sick with fear. “I never knew her,” he stammered. “I
never heard of her. You are mad.”"
174,16,52,"“You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you
are going to die.” There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know
what to say or do. “Down on your knees!” growled the man. “I give you
one minute to make your peace — no more. I go on board to - night for
India, and I must do my job first. One minute. That’s all.”"
174,16,53,"Dorian’s arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did not know
what to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain. “Stop,” he
cried. “How long ago is it since your sister died? Quick, tell me!”"
174,16,54,"“Eighteen years,” said the man. “Why do you ask me? What do years
matter?”"
174,16,55,"“Eighteen years,” laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his
voice. “Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my face!”"
174,16,56,"James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.
Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway."
174,16,57,"Dim and wavering as was the wind - blown light, yet it served to show him
the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face
of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the
unstained purity of youth. He seemed little more than a lad of twenty
summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been
when they had parted so many years ago. It was obvious that this was
not the man who had destroyed her life."
174,16,58,"He loosened his hold and reeled back. “My God! my God!” he cried, “and
I would have murdered you!”"
174,16,59,"Dorian Gray drew a long breath. “You have been on the brink of
committing a terrible crime, my man,” he said, looking at him sternly.
“Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own
hands.”"
174,16,60,"“Forgive me, sir,” muttered James Vane. “I was deceived. A chance word
I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.”"
174,16,61,"“You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into
trouble,” said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the
street."
174,16,62,"James Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling from head
to foot. After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping
along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him
with stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked
round with a start. It was one of the women who had been drinking at
the bar."
174,16,63,"“Why didn’t you kill him?” she hissed out, putting haggard face quite
close to his. “I knew you were following him when you rushed out from
Daly’s. You fool! You should have killed him. He has lots of money, and
he’s as bad as bad.”"
174,16,64,"“He is not the man I am looking for,” he answered, “and I want no man’s
money. I want a man’s life. The man whose life I want must be nearly
forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I have not
got his blood upon my hands.”"
174,16,65,"The woman gave a bitter laugh. “Little more than a boy!” she sneered.
“Why, man, it’s nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me
what I am.”"
174,16,66,“You lie!” cried James Vane.
174,16,67,"She raised her hand up to heaven. “Before God I am telling the truth,”
she cried."
174,16,68,“Before God?”
174,16,69,"“Strike me dumb if it ain’t so. He is the worst one that comes here.
They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. It’s nigh
on eighteen years since I met him. He hasn’t changed much since then. I
have, though,” she added, with a sickly leer."
174,16,70,“You swear this?”
174,16,71,"“I swear it,” came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth. “But don’t give
me away to him,” she whined; “I am afraid of him. Let me have some
money for my night’s lodging.”"
174,16,72,"He broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street,
but Dorian Gray had disappeared. When he looked back, the woman had
vanished also."
174,17,1,"A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby
Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband,
a jaded - looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. It was tea - time,
and the mellow light of the huge, lace - covered lamp that stood on the
table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at
which the duchess was presiding. Her white hands were moving daintily
among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that
Dorian had whispered to her. Lord Henry was lying back in a silk - draped
wicker chair, looking at them. On a peach - coloured divan sat Lady
Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke’s description of the last
Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection. Three young men
in elaborate smoking - suits were handing tea - cakes to some of the women.
The house - party consisted of twelve people, and there were more
expected to arrive on the next day."
174,17,2,"“What are you two talking about?” said Lord Henry, strolling over to
the table and putting his cup down. “I hope Dorian has told you about
my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.”"
174,17,3,"“But I don’t want to be rechristened, Harry,” rejoined the duchess,
looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. “I am quite satisfied with
my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.”"
174,17,4,"“My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are
both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an
orchid, for my button - hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as
effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked one
of the gardeners what it was called. He told me it was a fine specimen
of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind. It is a sad
truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.
Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is
with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The
man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It
is the only thing he is fit for.”"
174,17,5,"“Then what should we call you, Harry?” she asked."
174,17,6,"“His name is Prince Paradox,” said Dorian."
174,17,7,"“I recognize him in a flash,” exclaimed the duchess."
174,17,8,"“I won’t hear of it,” laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair. “From a
label there is no escape! I refuse the title.”"
174,17,9,"“Royalties may not abdicate,” fell as a warning from pretty lips."
174,17,10,"“You wish me to defend my throne, then?”"
174,17,11,“Yes.”
174,17,12,“I give the truths of to - morrow.”
174,17,13,"“I prefer the mistakes of to - day,” she answered."
174,17,14,"“You disarm me, Gladys,” he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood."
174,17,15,"“Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.”"
174,17,16,"“I never tilt against beauty,” he said, with a wave of his hand."
174,17,17,"“That is your error, Harry, believe me. You value beauty far too much.”"
174,17,18,"“How can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be
beautiful than to be good. But on the other hand, no one is more ready
than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.”"
174,17,19,"“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?” cried the duchess.
“What becomes of your simile about the orchid?”"
174,17,20,"“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good
Tory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly
virtues have made our England what she is.”"
174,17,21,"“You don’t like your country, then?” she asked."
174,17,22,“I live in it.”
174,17,23,“That you may censure it the better.”
174,17,24,“Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?” he inquired.
174,17,25,“What do they say of us?”
174,17,26,“That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.”
174,17,27,"“Is that yours, Harry?”"
174,17,28,“I give it to you.”
174,17,29,“I could not use it. It is too true.”
174,17,30,“You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a description.”
174,17,31,“They are practical.”
174,17,32,"“They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger,
they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.”"
174,17,33,"“Still, we have done great things.”"
174,17,34,"“Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.”"
174,17,35,“We have carried their burden.”
174,17,36,“Only as far as the Stock Exchange.”
174,17,37,"She shook her head. “I believe in the race,” she cried."
174,17,38,“It represents the survival of the pushing.”
174,17,39,“It has development.”
174,17,40,“Decay fascinates me more.”
174,17,41,“What of art?” she asked.
174,17,42,“It is a malady.”
174,17,43,“Love?”
174,17,44,“An illusion.”
174,17,45,“Religion?”
174,17,46,“The fashionable substitute for belief.”
174,17,47,“You are a sceptic.”
174,17,48,“Never! Scepticism is the beginning of faith.”
174,17,49,“What are you?”
174,17,50,“To define is to limit.”
174,17,51,“Give me a clue.”
174,17,52,“Threads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth.”
174,17,53,“You bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else.”
174,17,54,"“Our host is a delightful topic. Years ago he was christened Prince
Charming.”"
174,17,55,"“Ah! don’t remind me of that,” cried Dorian Gray."
174,17,56,"“Our host is rather horrid this evening,” answered the duchess,
colouring. “I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely
scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern
butterfly.”"
174,17,57,"“Well, I hope he won’t stick pins into you, Duchess,” laughed Dorian."
174,17,58,"“Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me.”"
174,17,59,"“And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?”"
174,17,60,"“For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because I
come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by
half - past eight.”"
174,17,61,“How unreasonable of her! You should give her warning.”
174,17,62,"“I daren’t, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember the
one I wore at Lady Hilstone’s garden - party? You don’t, but it is nice
of you to pretend that you do. Well, she made it out of nothing. All
good hats are made out of nothing.”"
174,17,63,"“Like all good reputations, Gladys,” interrupted Lord Henry. “Every
effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be
a mediocrity.”"
174,17,64,"“Not with women,” said the duchess, shaking her head; “and women rule
the world. I assure you we can’t bear mediocrities. We women, as some
one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if
you ever love at all.”"
174,17,65,"“It seems to me that we never do anything else,” murmured Dorian."
174,17,66,"“Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,” answered the duchess with
mock sadness."
174,17,67,"“My dear Gladys!” cried Lord Henry. “How can you say that? Romance
lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.
Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.
Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely
intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best,
and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as
possible.”"
174,17,68,"“Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?” asked the duchess after
a pause."
174,17,69,"“Especially when one has been wounded by it,” answered Lord Henry."
174,17,70,"The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression
in her eyes. “What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?” she inquired."
174,17,71,"Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and laughed.
“I always agree with Harry, Duchess.”"
174,17,72,“Even when he is wrong?”
174,17,73,"“Harry is never wrong, Duchess.”"
174,17,74,“And does his philosophy make you happy?”
174,17,75,"“I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have
searched for pleasure.”"
174,17,76,"“And found it, Mr. Gray?”"
174,17,77,“Often. Too often.”
174,17,78,"The duchess sighed. “I am searching for peace,” she said, “and if I
don’t go and dress, I shall have none this evening.”"
174,17,79,"“Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,” cried Dorian, starting to his
feet and walking down the conservatory."
174,17,80,"“You are flirting disgracefully with him,” said Lord Henry to his
cousin. “You had better take care. He is very fascinating.”"
174,17,81,"“If he were not, there would be no battle.”"
174,17,82,"“Greek meets Greek, then?”"
174,17,83,“I am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman.”
174,17,84,“They were defeated.”
174,17,85,"“There are worse things than capture,” she answered."
174,17,86,“You gallop with a loose rein.”
174,17,87,"“Pace gives life,” was the _riposte_."
174,17,88,“I shall write it in my diary to - night.”
174,17,89,“What?”
174,17,90,“That a burnt child loves the fire.”
174,17,91,“I am not even singed. My wings are untouched.”
174,17,92,"“You use them for everything, except flight.”"
174,17,93,“Courage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for us.”
174,17,94,“You have a rival.”
174,17,95,“Who?”
174,17,96,"He laughed. “Lady Narborough,” he whispered. “She perfectly adores
him.”"
174,17,97,"“You fill me with apprehension. The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us
who are romanticists.”"
174,17,98,“Romanticists! You have all the methods of science.”
174,17,99,“Men have educated us.”
174,17,100,“But not explained you.”
174,17,101,"“Describe us as a sex,” was her challenge."
174,17,102,“Sphinxes without secrets.”
174,17,103,"She looked at him, smiling. “How long Mr. Gray is!” she said. “Let us
go and help him. I have not yet told him the colour of my frock.”"
174,17,104,"“Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.”"
174,17,105,“That would be a premature surrender.”
174,17,106,“Romantic art begins with its climax.”
174,17,107,“I must keep an opportunity for retreat.”
174,17,108,“In the Parthian manner?”
174,17,109,“They found safety in the desert. I could not do that.”
174,17,110,"“Women are not always allowed a choice,” he answered, but hardly had he
finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came
a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall. Everybody
started up. The duchess stood motionless in horror. And with fear in
his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian
Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon."
174,17,111,"He was carried at once into the blue drawing - room and laid upon one of
the sofas. After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with
a dazed expression."
174,17,112,"“What has happened?” he asked. “Oh! I remember. Am I safe here, Harry?”
He began to tremble."
174,17,113,"“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, “you merely fainted. That was
all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to
dinner. I will take your place.”"
174,17,114,"“No, I will come down,” he said, struggling to his feet. “I would
rather come down. I must not be alone.”"
174,17,115,"He went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of
gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of
terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the
window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the
face of James Vane watching him."
174,18,1,"The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the
time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet
indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared,
tracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry did but
tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were blown against
the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild
regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor’s face
peering through the mist - stained glass, and horror seemed once more to
lay its hand upon his heart."
174,18,2,"But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of
the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him. Actual
life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the
imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of
sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen
brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor
the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon
the weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling round
the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers. Had
any foot - marks been found on the flower - beds, the gardeners would have
reported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane’s brother had
not come back to kill him. He had sailed away in his ship to founder in
some winter sea. From him, at any rate, he was safe. Why, the man did
not know who he was, could not know who he was. The mask of youth had
saved him."
174,18,3,"And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think
that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them
visible form, and make them move before one! What sort of life would
his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from
silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear
as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!
As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and
the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder. Oh! in what a
wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere
memory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back
to him with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and
swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin. When Lord Henry came in
at six o’clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break."
174,18,4,"It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There was
something in the clear, pine - scented air of that winter morning that
seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life. But it
was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused
the change. His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish
that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. With subtle
and finely wrought temperaments it is always so. Their strong passions
must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves
die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows
that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides, he had
convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror - stricken
imagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity
and not a little of contempt."
174,18,5,"After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden
and then drove across the park to join the shooting - party. The crisp
frost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an inverted cup of blue
metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed - grown lake."
174,18,6,"At the corner of the pine - wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey
Clouston, the duchess’s brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of
his gun. He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the
mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken
and rough undergrowth."
174,18,7,"“Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?” he asked."
174,18,8,"“Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the
open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new
ground.”"
174,18,9,"Dorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and
red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters
ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that
followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful
freedom. He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high
indifference of joy."
174,18,10,"Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front
of them, with black - tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it
forward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir
Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the
animal’s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he
cried out at once, “Don’t shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.”"
174,18,11,"“What nonsense, Dorian!” laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded
into the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a
hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is
worse."
174,18,12,"“Good heavens! I have hit a beater!” exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. “What an
ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting there!” he
called out at the top of his voice. “A man is hurt.”"
174,18,13,The head - keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.
174,18,14,"“Where, sir? Where is he?” he shouted. At the same time, the firing
ceased along the line."
174,18,15,"“Here,” answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.
“Why on earth don’t you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for the
day.”"
174,18,16,"Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder - clump, brushing the
lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging
a body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It
seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went. He heard Sir
Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of
the keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with
faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of
voices. A great copper - breasted pheasant came beating through the
boughs overhead."
174,18,17,"After a few moments — that were to him, in his perturbed state, like
endless hours of pain — he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He started
and looked round."
174,18,18,"“Dorian,” said Lord Henry, “I had better tell them that the shooting is
stopped for to - day. It would not look well to go on.”"
174,18,19,"“I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,” he answered bitterly. “The
whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?”"
174,18,20,He could not finish the sentence.
174,18,21,"“I am afraid so,” rejoined Lord Henry. “He got the whole charge of shot
in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let us go
home.”"
174,18,22,"They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly
fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and
said, with a heavy sigh, “It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.”"
174,18,23,"“What is?” asked Lord Henry. “Oh! this accident, I suppose. My dear
fellow, it can’t be helped. It was the man’s own fault. Why did he get
in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather
awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper beaters. It
makes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he
shoots very straight. But there is no use talking about the matter.”"
174,18,24,"Dorian shook his head. “It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if something
horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps,” he
added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain."
174,18,25,"The elder man laughed. “The only horrible thing in the world is
_ennui_, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.
But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep
chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the
subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no such thing as an
omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel
for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian? You have
everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would
not be delighted to change places with you.”"
174,18,26,"“There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don’t
laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant who
has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It is
the coming of death that terrifies me. Its monstrous wings seem to
wheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! don’t you see a man
moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?”"
174,18,27,"Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand
was pointing. “Yes,” he said, smiling, “I see the gardener waiting for
you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the
table to - night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You must
come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.”"
174,18,28,"Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching. The
man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating
manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master. “Her
Grace told me to wait for an answer,” he murmured."
174,18,29,"Dorian put the letter into his pocket. “Tell her Grace that I am coming
in,” he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly in the
direction of the house."
174,18,30,"“How fond women are of doing dangerous things!” laughed Lord Henry. “It
is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt
with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.”"
174,18,31,"“How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present
instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I
don’t love her.”"
174,18,32,"“And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you
are excellently matched.”"
174,18,33,"“You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for
scandal.”"
174,18,34,"“The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,” said Lord Henry,
lighting a cigarette."
174,18,35,"“You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.”"
174,18,36,"“The world goes to the altar of its own accord,” was the answer."
174,18,37,"“I wish I could love,” cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in
his voice. “But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the
desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has
become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It was
silly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a wire to
Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On a yacht one is safe.”"
174,18,38,"“Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me what
it is? You know I would help you.”"
174,18,39,"“I can’t tell you, Harry,” he answered sadly. “And I dare say it is
only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have a
horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.”"
174,18,40,“What nonsense!”
174,18,41,"“I hope it is, but I can’t help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess,
looking like Artemis in a tailor - made gown. You see we have come back,
Duchess.”"
174,18,42,"“I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,” she answered. “Poor Geoffrey is
terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.
How curious!”"
174,18,43,"“Yes, it was very curious. I don’t know what made me say it. Some whim,
I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am
sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous subject.”"
174,18,44,"“It is an annoying subject,” broke in Lord Henry. “It has no
psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on
purpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some one
who had committed a real murder.”"
174,18,45,"“How horrid of you, Harry!” cried the duchess. “Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?
Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint.”"
174,18,46,"Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. “It is nothing,
Duchess,” he murmured; “my nerves are dreadfully out of order. That is
all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn’t hear what
Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think
I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won’t you?”"
174,18,47,"They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the
conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian,
Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes.
“Are you very much in love with him?” he asked."
174,18,48,"She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape. “I
wish I knew,” she said at last."
174,18,49,"He shook his head. “Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty
that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.”"
174,18,50,“One may lose one’s way.”
174,18,51,"“All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.”"
174,18,52,“What is that?”
174,18,53,“Disillusion.”
174,18,54,"“It was my _début_ in life,” she sighed."
174,18,55,“It came to you crowned.”
174,18,56,“I am tired of strawberry leaves.”
174,18,57,“They become you.”
174,18,58,“Only in public.”
174,18,59,"“You would miss them,” said Lord Henry."
174,18,60,“I will not part with a petal.”
174,18,61,“Monmouth has ears.”
174,18,62,“Old age is dull of hearing.”
174,18,63,“Has he never been jealous?”
174,18,64,“I wish he had been.”
174,18,65,"He glanced about as if in search of something. “What are you looking
for?” she inquired."
174,18,66,"“The button from your foil,” he answered. “You have dropped it.”"
174,18,67,She laughed. “I have still the mask.”
174,18,68,"“It makes your eyes lovelier,” was his reply."
174,18,69,"She laughed again. Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet
fruit."
174,18,70,"Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror
in every tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly become too
hideous a burden for him to bear. The dreadful death of the unlucky
beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to
pre - figure death for himself also. He had nearly swooned at what Lord
Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting."
174,18,71,"At five o’clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to
pack his things for the night - express to town, and to have the brougham
at the door by eight - thirty. He was determined not to sleep another
night at Selby Royal. It was an ill - omened place. Death walked there in
the sunlight. The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood."
174,18,72,"Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to
town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in
his absence. As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to
the door, and his valet informed him that the head - keeper wished to see
him. He frowned and bit his lip. “Send him in,” he muttered, after some
moments’ hesitation."
174,18,73,"As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a
drawer and spread it out before him."
174,18,74,"“I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this
morning, Thornton?” he said, taking up a pen."
174,18,75,"“Yes, sir,” answered the gamekeeper."
174,18,76,"“Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?”
asked Dorian, looking bored. “If so, I should not like them to be left
in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.”"
174,18,77,"“We don’t know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of
coming to you about.”"
174,18,78,"“Don’t know who he is?” said Dorian, listlessly. “What do you mean?
Wasn’t he one of your men?”"
174,18,79,"“No, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir.”"
174,18,80,"The pen dropped from Dorian Gray’s hand, and he felt as if his heart
had suddenly stopped beating. “A sailor?” he cried out. “Did you say a
sailor?”"
174,18,81,"“Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on
both arms, and that kind of thing.”"
174,18,82,"“Was there anything found on him?” said Dorian, leaning forward and
looking at the man with startled eyes. “Anything that would tell his
name?”"
174,18,83,"“Some money, sir — not much, and a six - shooter. There was no name of any
kind. A decent - looking man, sir, but rough - like. A sort of sailor we
think.”"
174,18,84,"Dorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him. He
clutched at it madly. “Where is the body?” he exclaimed. “Quick! I must
see it at once.”"
174,18,85,"“It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don’t like to
have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse brings bad
luck.”"
174,18,86,"“The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms to
bring my horse round. No. Never mind. I’ll go to the stables myself. It
will save time.”"
174,18,87,"In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the
long avenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to sweep past him
in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his
path. Once the mare swerved at a white gate - post and nearly threw him.
He lashed her across the neck with his crop. She cleft the dusky air
like an arrow. The stones flew from her hoofs."
174,18,88,"At last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the yard.
He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the
farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to tell him
that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand
upon the latch."
174,18,89,"There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a
discovery that would either make or mar his life. Then he thrust the
door open and entered."
174,18,90,"On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man
dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted
handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse candle, stuck in a
bottle, sputtered beside it."
174,18,91,"Dorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to take
the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm - servants to
come to him."
174,18,92,"“Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it,” he said, clutching at
the door - post for support."
174,18,93,"When the farm - servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of joy
broke from his lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket was James
Vane."
174,18,94,"He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he rode
home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe."
174,19,1,"“There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,” cried
Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled
with rose - water. “You are quite perfect. Pray, don’t change.”"
174,19,2,"Dorian Gray shook his head. “No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful
things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began my good
actions yesterday.”"
174,19,3,“Where were you yesterday?”
174,19,4,"“In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself.”"
174,19,5,"“My dear boy,” said Lord Henry, smiling, “anybody can be good in the
country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people
who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not
by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by
which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being
corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they
stagnate.”"
174,19,6,"“Culture and corruption,” echoed Dorian. “I have known something of
both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found
together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I
have altered.”"
174,19,7,"“You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say you
had done more than one?” asked his companion as he spilled into his
plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a
perforated, shell - shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them."
174,19,8,"“I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else.
I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She
was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was
that which first attracted me to her. You remember Sibyl, don’t you?
How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of
course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I
am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we
have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a
week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple - blossoms kept
tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone
away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her
as flowerlike as I had found her.”"
174,19,9,"“I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill
of real pleasure, Dorian,” interrupted Lord Henry. “But I can finish
your idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That
was the beginning of your reformation.”"
174,19,10,"“Harry, you are horrible! You mustn’t say these dreadful things.
Hetty’s heart is not broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But
there is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her
garden of mint and marigold.”"
174,19,11,"“And weep over a faithless Florizel,” said Lord Henry, laughing, as he
leaned back in his chair. “My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously
boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now
with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to
a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of having met
you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will
be wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much
of your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides,
how do you know that Hetty isn’t floating at the present moment in some
starlit mill - pond, with lovely water - lilies round her, like Ophelia?”"
174,19,12,"“I can’t bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest the
most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don’t care what
you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I
rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window,
like a spray of jasmine. Don’t let us talk about it any more, and don’t
try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years,
the first little bit of self - sacrifice I have ever known, is really a
sort of sin. I want to be better. I am going to be better. Tell me
something about yourself. What is going on in town? I have not been to
the club for days.”"
174,19,13,“The people are still discussing poor Basil’s disappearance.”
174,19,14,"“I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,” said
Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly."
174,19,15,"“My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and
the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having
more than one topic every three months. They have been very fortunate
lately, however. They have had my own divorce - case and Alan Campbell’s
suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.
Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left
for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor
Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris
at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has
been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who
disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful
city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.”"
174,19,16,"“What do you think has happened to Basil?” asked Dorian, holding up his
Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could
discuss the matter so calmly."
174,19,17,"“I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is
no business of mine. If he is dead, I don’t want to think about him.
Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.”"
174,19,18,“Why?” said the younger man wearily.
174,19,19,"“Because,” said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt
trellis of an open vinaigrette box, “one can survive everything
nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the
nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee
in the music - room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with
whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was
very fond of her. The house is rather lonely without her. Of course,
married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the
loss even of one’s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most.
They are such an essential part of one’s personality.”"
174,19,20,"Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next
room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white
and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he
stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, “Harry, did it ever
occur to you that Basil was murdered?”"
174,19,21,"Lord Henry yawned. “Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury
watch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever enough to
have enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a
man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible. Basil was
really rather dull. He only interested me once, and that was when he
told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you
were the dominant motive of his art.”"
174,19,22,"“I was very fond of Basil,” said Dorian with a note of sadness in his
voice. “But don’t people say that he was murdered?”"
174,19,23,"“Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all
probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not
the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his
chief defect.”"
174,19,24,"“What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?”
said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had spoken."
174,19,25,"“I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that
doesn’t suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.
It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your
vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs
exclusively to the lower orders. I don’t blame them in the smallest
degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply
a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.”"
174,19,26,"“A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who
has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?
Don’t tell me that.”"
174,19,27,"“Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,” cried Lord
Henry, laughing. “That is one of the most important secrets of life. I
should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should
never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us
pass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he had come to such a
really romantic end as you suggest, but I can’t. I dare say he fell
into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the
scandal. Yes: I should fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on
his back under those dull - green waters, with the heavy barges floating
over him and long weeds catching in his hair. Do you know, I don’t
think he would have done much more good work. During the last ten years
his painting had gone off very much.”"
174,19,28,"Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began
to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey - plumaged
bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo
perch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of
crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards
and forwards."
174,19,29,"“Yes,” he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of
his pocket; “his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me to have
lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he ceased to be
great friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What was it separated
you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never forgave you. It’s a habit
bores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he
did of you? I don’t think I have ever seen it since he finished it. Oh!
I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to
Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way. You never got
it back? What a pity! it was really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted
to buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to Basil’s best period. Since
then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good
intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative
British artist. Did you advertise for it? You should.”"
174,19,30,"“I forget,” said Dorian. “I suppose I did. But I never really liked it.
I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me. Why
do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some
play — Hamlet, I think — how do they run? —"
174,19,31,"“Like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart.”"
174,19,32,Yes: that is what it was like.”
174,19,33,"Lord Henry laughed. “If a man treats life artistically, his brain is
his heart,” he answered, sinking into an arm - chair."
174,19,34,"Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.
“‘Like the painting of a sorrow,’” he repeated, “‘a face without a
heart.’”"
174,19,35,"The elder man lay back and looked at him with half - closed eyes. “By the
way, Dorian,” he said after a pause, “‘what does it profit a man if he
gain the whole world and lose — how does the quotation run? — his own
soul’?”"
174,19,36,"The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.
“Why do you ask me that, Harry?”"
174,19,37,"“My dear fellow,” said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,
“I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.
That is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the
Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby - looking people
listening to some vulgar street - preacher. As I passed by, I heard the
man yelling out that question to his audience. It struck me as being
rather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. A
wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly
white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful
phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips — it was really very
good in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet
that art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he
would not have understood me.”"
174,19,38,"“Don’t, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and
sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is
a soul in each one of us. I know it.”"
174,19,39,"“Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?”"
174,19,40,“Quite sure.”
174,19,41,"“Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely
certain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the
lesson of romance. How grave you are! Don’t be so serious. What have
you or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given up
our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian,
and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your
youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you
are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful,
Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do to - night. You
remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy,
and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in
appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth
I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early,
or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It’s absurd to talk
of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen
now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in
front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder. As for the
aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask
them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly
give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks,
believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that
thing you are playing is! I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca,
with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against
the panes? It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that
there is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don’t stop. I want
music to - night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I
am Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that
even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is
old, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.
Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You
have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against
your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you. And it has all been to
you no more than the sound of music. It has not marred you. You are
still the same.”"
174,19,42,"“I am not the same, Harry.”"
174,19,43,"“Yes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be.
Don’t spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.
Don’t make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need
not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don’t deceive
yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question
of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built - up cells in which thought hides
itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe and
think yourself strong. But a chance tone of colour in a room or a
morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that
brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you
had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had
ceased to play — I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that
our lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own
senses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odour of
_lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the
strangest month of my life over again. I wish I could change places
with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has
always worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of
what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found. I am
so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or
painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has
been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your
sonnets.”"
174,19,44,"Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.
“Yes, life has been exquisite,” he murmured, “but I am not going to
have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant
things to me. You don’t know everything about me. I think that if you
did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don’t laugh.”"
174,19,45,"“Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the nocturne
over again. Look at that great, honey - coloured moon that hangs in the
dusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she
will come closer to the earth. You won’t? Let us go to the club, then.
It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is
some one at White’s who wants immensely to know you — young Lord Poole,
Bournemouth’s eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has
begged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful and rather
reminds me of you.”"
174,19,46,"“I hope not,” said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes. “But I am tired
to - night, Harry. I shan’t go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I
want to go to bed early.”"
174,19,47,"“Do stay. You have never played so well as to - night. There was
something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression than
I had ever heard from it before.”"
174,19,48,"“It is because I am going to be good,” he answered, smiling. “I am a
little changed already.”"
174,19,49,"“You cannot change to me, Dorian,” said Lord Henry. “You and I will
always be friends.”"
174,19,50,"“Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.
Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It
does harm.”"
174,19,51,"“My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be
going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people
against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too
delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we
are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,
there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It
annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that
the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.
That is all. But we won’t discuss literature. Come round to - morrow. I
am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take you
to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and
wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.
Mind you come. Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she
never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you
would be. Her clever tongue gets on one’s nerves. Well, in any case, be
here at eleven.”"
174,19,52,"“Must I really come, Harry?”"
174,19,53,"“Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don’t think there have been
such lilacs since the year I met you.”"
174,19,54,"“Very well. I shall be here at eleven,” said Dorian. “Good night,
Harry.” As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had
something more to say. Then he sighed and went out."
174,20,1,"It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and
did not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled home,
smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him. He
heard one of them whisper to the other, “That is Dorian Gray.” He
remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared
at, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own name now. Half the
charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that
no one knew who he was. He had often told the girl whom he had lured to
love him that he was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her
once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that
wicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a laugh she
had! — just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her
cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had
everything that he had lost."
174,20,2,"When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent
him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and
began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him."
174,20,3,"Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing
for the unstained purity of his boyhood — his rose - white boyhood, as Lord
Henry had once called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled
his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had
been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in
being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been
the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame.
But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?"
174,20,4,"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that
the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the
unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to
that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure
swift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment. Not
“Forgive us our sins” but “Smite us for our iniquities” should be the
prayer of man to a most just God."
174,20,5,"The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many
years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white - limbed Cupids
laughed round it as of old. He took it up, as he had done on that night
of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and
with wild, tear - dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield. Once, some
one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter, ending
with these idolatrous words: “The world is changed because you are made
of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.” The
phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to
himself. Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the
floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his
beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed
for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from
stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.
What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow
moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery? Youth had
spoiled him."
174,20,6,"It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It
was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane
was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had
shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the
secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it was,
over Basil Hallward’s disappearance would soon pass away. It was
already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the
death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the
living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the
portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It
was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him
that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The
murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell,
his suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do it. It was
nothing to him."
174,20,7,"A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting for.
Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing, at
any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good."
174,20,8,"As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in
the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it
had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel
every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had
already gone away. He would go and look."
174,20,9,"He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the
door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young - looking face
and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and
the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror
to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already."
174,20,10,"He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and
dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and
indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the
eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of
the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome — more loathsome, if
possible, than before — and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed
brighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it
been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the
desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking
laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things
finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the
red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a
horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the
painted feet, as though the thing had dripped — blood even on the hand
that had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to
confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt
that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would
believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.
Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned
what had been below - stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.
They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his
duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.
There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well
as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had
told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of
Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty
Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he
was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing
more in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At
least he thought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing
more. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the
mask of goodness. For curiosity’s sake he had tried the denial of self.
He recognized that now."
174,20,11,"But this murder — was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be
burdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was only
one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself — that was
evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it had
given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he had
felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been
away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon
it. It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had
marred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it
had been conscience. He would destroy it."
174,20,12,"He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He
had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was
bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill
the painter’s work, and all that that meant. It would kill the past,
and when that was dead, he would be free. It would kill this monstrous
soul - life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He
seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it."
174,20,13,"There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its
agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.
Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked
up at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and
brought him back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was no
answer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all
dark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and
watched."
174,20,14,"“Whose house is that, Constable?” asked the elder of the two gentlemen."
174,20,15,"“Mr. Dorian Gray’s, sir,” answered the policeman."
174,20,16,"They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of
them was Sir Henry Ashton’s uncle."
174,20,17,"Inside, in the servants’ part of the house, the half - clad domestics
were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying
and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death."
174,20,18,"After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the
footmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They
called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force
the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony. The
windows yielded easily — their bolts were old."
174,20,19,"When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait
of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his
exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in
evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled,
and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings
that they recognized who it was."

175,1,1,"It was the evening on which MM. Debienne and Poligny, the managers of
the Opera, were giving a last gala performance to mark their
retirement.  Suddenly the dressing - room of La Sorelli, one of the
principal dancers, was invaded by half - a - dozen young ladies of the
ballet, who had come up from the stage after ""dancing"" Polyeucte.  They
rushed in amid great confusion, some giving vent to forced and
unnatural laughter, others to cries of terror.  Sorelli, who wished to
be alone for a moment to ""run through"" the speech which she was to make
to the resigning managers, looked around angrily at the mad and
tumultuous crowd.  It was little Jammes -  - the girl with the tip - tilted
nose, the forget - me - not eyes, the rose - red cheeks and the lily - white
neck and shoulders -  - who gave the explanation in a trembling voice:"
175,1,2,"""It's the ghost!""  And she locked the door."
175,1,3,"Sorelli's dressing - room was fitted up with official, commonplace
elegance.  A pier - glass, a sofa, a dressing - table and a cupboard or two
provided the necessary furniture.  On the walls hung a few engravings,
relics of the mother, who had known the glories of the old Opera in the
Rue le Peletier; portraits of Vestris, Gardel, Dupont, Bigottini.  But
the room seemed a palace to the brats of the corps de ballet, who were
lodged in common dressing - rooms where they spent their time singing,
quarreling, smacking the dressers and hair - dressers and buying one
another glasses of cassis, beer, or even rhum, until the call - boy's
bell rang."
175,1,4,"Sorelli was very superstitious.  She shuddered when she heard little
Jammes speak of the ghost, called her a ""silly little fool"" and then,
as she was the first to believe in ghosts in general, and the Opera
ghost in particular, at once asked for details:"
175,1,5,"""Have you seen him?"""
175,1,6,"""As plainly as I see you now!"" said little Jammes, whose legs were
giving way beneath her, and she dropped with a moan into a chair."
175,1,7,"Thereupon little Giry -  - the girl with eyes black as sloes, hair black as
ink, a swarthy complexion and a poor little skin stretched over poor
little bones -  - little Giry added:"
175,1,8,"""If that's the ghost, he's very ugly!"""
175,1,9,"""Oh, yes!"" cried the chorus of ballet - girls."
175,1,10,"And they all began to talk together.  The ghost had appeared to them in
the shape of a gentleman in dress - clothes, who had suddenly stood
before them in the passage, without their knowing where he came from.
He seemed to have come straight through the wall."
175,1,11,"""Pooh!"" said one of them, who had more or less kept her head.  ""You see
the ghost everywhere!"""
175,1,12,"And it was true.  For several months, there had been nothing discussed
at the Opera but this ghost in dress - clothes who stalked about the
building, from top to bottom, like a shadow, who spoke to nobody, to
whom nobody dared speak and who vanished as soon as he was seen, no one
knowing how or where.  As became a real ghost, he made no noise in
walking.  People began by laughing and making fun of this specter
dressed like a man of fashion or an undertaker; but the ghost legend
soon swelled to enormous proportions among the corps de ballet.  All
the girls pretended to have met this supernatural being more or less
often.  And those who laughed the loudest were not the most at ease.
When he did not show himself, he betrayed his presence or his passing
by accident, comic or serious, for which the general superstition held
him responsible.  Had any one met with a fall, or suffered a practical
joke at the hands of one of the other girls, or lost a powderpuff, it
was at once the fault of the ghost, of the Opera ghost."
175,1,13,"After all, who had seen him?  You meet so many men in dress - clothes at
the Opera who are not ghosts.  But this dress - suit had a peculiarity of
its own.  It covered a skeleton.  At least, so the ballet - girls said.
And, of course, it had a death's head."
175,1,14,"Was all this serious?  The truth is that the idea of the skeleton came
from the description of the ghost given by Joseph Buquet, the chief
scene - shifter, who had really seen the ghost.  He had run up against
the ghost on the little staircase, by the footlights, which leads to
""the cellars.""  He had seen him for a second -  - for the ghost had
fled -  - and to any one who cared to listen to him he said:"
175,1,15,"""He is extraordinarily thin and his dress - coat hangs on a skeleton
frame.  His eyes are so deep that you can hardly see the fixed pupils.
You just see two big black holes, as in a dead man's skull.  His skin,
which is stretched across his bones like a drumhead, is not white, but
a nasty yellow.  His nose is so little worth talking about that you
can't see it side - face; and THE ABSENCE of that nose is a horrible
thing TO LOOK AT.  All the hair he has is three or four long dark locks
on his forehead and behind his ears."""
175,1,16,"This chief scene - shifter was a serious, sober, steady man, very slow at
imagining things.  His words were received with interest and amazement;
and soon there were other people to say that they too had met a man in
dress - clothes with a death's head on his shoulders.  Sensible men who
had wind of the story began by saying that Joseph Buquet had been the
victim of a joke played by one of his assistants.  And then, one after
the other, there came a series of incidents so curious and so
inexplicable that the very shrewdest people began to feel uneasy."
175,1,17,"For instance, a fireman is a brave fellow!  He fears nothing, least of
all fire!  Well, the fireman in question, who had gone to make a round
of inspection in the cellars and who, it seems, had ventured a little
farther than usual, suddenly reappeared on the stage, pale, scared,
trembling, with his eyes starting out of his head, and practically
fainted in the arms of the proud mother of little Jammes.[1]  And why?
Because he had seen coming toward him, AT THE LEVEL OF HIS HEAD, BUT
WITHOUT A BODY ATTACHED TO IT, A HEAD OF FIRE!  And, as I said, a
fireman is not afraid of fire."
175,1,18,The fireman's name was Pampin.
175,1,19,"The corps de ballet was flung into consternation.  At first sight, this
fiery head in no way corresponded with Joseph Buquet's description of
the ghost.  But the young ladies soon persuaded themselves that the
ghost had several heads, which he changed about as he pleased.  And, of
course, they at once imagined that they were in the greatest danger.
Once a fireman did not hesitate to faint, leaders and front - row and
back - row girls alike had plenty of excuses for the fright that made
them quicken their pace when passing some dark corner or ill - lighted
corridor.  Sorelli herself, on the day after the adventure of the
fireman, placed a horseshoe on the table in front of the
stage - door - keeper's box, which every one who entered the Opera
otherwise than as a spectator must touch before setting foot on the
first tread of the staircase.  This horse - shoe was not invented by
me -  - any more than any other part of this story, alas! -  - and may still be
seen on the table in the passage outside the stage - door - keeper's box,
when you enter the Opera through the court known as the Cour de
l'Administration."
175,1,20,To return to the evening in question.
175,1,21,"""It's the ghost!"" little Jammes had cried."
175,1,22,"An agonizing silence now reigned in the dressing - room. Nothing was
heard but the hard breathing of the girls.  At last, Jammes, flinging
herself upon the farthest corner of the wall, with every mark of real
terror on her face, whispered:"
175,1,23,"""Listen!"""
175,1,24,"Everybody seemed to hear a rustling outside the door.  There was no
sound of footsteps.  It was like light silk sliding over the panel.
Then it stopped."
175,1,25,"Sorelli tried to show more pluck than the others.  She went up to the
door and, in a quavering voice, asked:"
175,1,26,"""Who's there?"""
175,1,27,"But nobody answered.  Then feeling all eyes upon her, watching her last
movement, she made an effort to show courage, and said very loudly:"
175,1,28,"""Is there any one behind the door?"""
175,1,29,"""Oh, yes, yes!  Of course there is!"" cried that little dried plum of a
Meg Giry, heroically holding Sorelli back by her gauze skirt.
""Whatever you do, don't open the door!  Oh, Lord, don't open the door!"""
175,1,30,"But Sorelli, armed with a dagger that never left her, turned the key
and drew back the door, while the ballet - girls retreated to the inner
dressing - room and Meg Giry sighed:"
175,1,31,"""Mother!  Mother!"""
175,1,32,"Sorelli looked into the passage bravely.  It was empty; a gas - flame, in
its glass prison, cast a red and suspicious light into the surrounding
darkness, without succeeding in dispelling it.  And the dancer slammed
the door again, with a deep sigh."
175,1,33,"""No,"" she said, ""there is no one there."""
175,1,34,"""Still, we saw him!""  Jammes declared, returning with timid little
steps to her place beside Sorelli.  ""He must be somewhere prowling
about.  I shan't go back to dress.  We had better all go down to the
foyer together, at once, for the 'speech,' and we will come up again
together."""
175,1,35,"And the child reverently touched the little coral finger - ring which she
wore as a charm against bad luck, while Sorelli, stealthily, with the
tip of her pink right thumb - nail, made a St. Andrew's cross on the
wooden ring which adorned the fourth finger of her left hand.  She said
to the little ballet - girls:"
175,1,36,"""Come, children, pull yourselves together!  I dare say no one has ever
seen the ghost."""
175,1,37,"""Yes, yes, we saw him -  - we saw him just now!"" cried the girls.  ""He had
his death's head and his dress - coat, just as when he appeared to Joseph
Buquet!"""
175,1,38,"""And Gabriel saw him too!"" said Jammes.  ""Only yesterday!  Yesterday
afternoon -  - in broad day - light -  -  -  - """
175,1,39,"""Gabriel, the chorus - master?"""
175,1,40,"""Why, yes, didn't you know?"""
175,1,41,"""And he was wearing his dress - clothes, in broad daylight?"""
175,1,42,"""Who?  Gabriel?"""
175,1,43,"""Why, no, the ghost!"""
175,1,44,"""Certainly!  Gabriel told me so himself.  That's what he knew him by.
Gabriel was in the stage - manager's office.  Suddenly the door opened
and the Persian entered.  You know the Persian has the evil eye -  -  -  - """
175,1,45,"""Oh, yes!"" answered the little ballet - girls in chorus, warding off
ill - luck by pointing their forefinger and little finger at the absent
Persian, while their second and third fingers were bent on the palm and
held down by the thumb."
175,1,46,"""And you know how superstitious Gabriel is,"" continued Jammes.
""However, he is always polite.  When he meets the Persian, he just puts
his hand in his pocket and touches his keys.  Well, the moment the
Persian appeared in the doorway, Gabriel gave one jump from his chair
to the lock of the cupboard, so as to touch iron!  In doing so, he tore
a whole skirt of his overcoat on a nail.  Hurrying to get out of the
room, he banged his forehead against a hat - peg and gave himself a huge
bump; then, suddenly stepping back, he skinned his arm on the screen,
near the piano; he tried to lean on the piano, but the lid fell on his
hands and crushed his fingers; he rushed out of the office like a
madman, slipped on the staircase and came down the whole of the first
flight on his back.  I was just passing with mother.  We picked him up.
He was covered with bruises and his face was all over blood.  We were
frightened out of our lives, but, all at once, he began to thank
Providence that he had got off so cheaply.  Then he told us what had
frightened him.  He had seen the ghost behind the Persian, THE GHOST
WITH THE DEATH'S HEAD just like Joseph Buquet's description!"""
175,1,47,"Jammes had told her story ever so quickly, as though the ghost were at
her heels, and was quite out of breath at the finish.  A silence
followed, while Sorelli polished her nails in great excitement.  It was
broken by little Giry, who said:"
175,1,48,"""Joseph Buquet would do better to hold his tongue."""
175,1,49,"""Why should he hold his tongue?"" asked somebody."
175,1,50,"""That's mother's opinion,"" replied Meg, lowering her voice and looking
all about her as though fearing lest other ears than those present
might overhear."
175,1,51,"""And why is it your mother's opinion?"""
175,1,52,"""Hush!  Mother says the ghost doesn't like being talked about."""
175,1,53,"""And why does your mother say so?"""
175,1,54,"""Because -  - because -  - nothing -  - """
175,1,55,"This reticence exasperated the curiosity of the young ladies, who
crowded round little Giry, begging her to explain herself.  They were
there, side by side, leaning forward simultaneously in one movement of
entreaty and fear, communicating their terror to one another, taking a
keen pleasure in feeling their blood freeze in their veins."
175,1,56,"""I swore not to tell!"" gasped Meg."
175,1,57,"But they left her no peace and promised to keep the secret, until Meg,
burning to say all she knew, began, with her eyes fixed on the door:"
175,1,58,"""Well, it's because of the private box."""
175,1,59,"""What private box?"""
175,1,60,"""The ghost's box!"""
175,1,61,"""Has the ghost a box?  Oh, do tell us, do tell us!"""
175,1,62,"""Not so loud!"" said Meg.  ""It's Box Five, you know, the box on the
grand tier, next to the stage - box, on the left."""
175,1,63,"""Oh, nonsense!"""
175,1,64,"""I tell you it is.  Mother has charge of it.  But you swear you won't
say a word?"""
175,1,65,"""Of course, of course."""
175,1,66,"""Well, that's the ghost's box.  No one has had it for over a month,
except the ghost, and orders have been given at the box - office that it
must never be sold."""
175,1,67,"""And does the ghost really come there?"""
175,1,68,"""Yes."""
175,1,69,"""Then somebody does come?"""
175,1,70,"""Why, no!  The ghost comes, but there is nobody there."""
175,1,71,"The little ballet - girls exchanged glances.  If the ghost came to the
box, he must be seen, because he wore a dress - coat and a death's head.
This was what they tried to make Meg understand, but she replied:"
175,1,72,"""That's just it!  The ghost is not seen.  And he has no dress - coat and
no head!  All that talk about his death's head and his head of fire is
nonsense!  There's nothing in it.  You only hear him when he is in the
box.  Mother has never seen him, but she has heard him.  Mother knows,
because she gives him his program."""
175,1,73,Sorelli interfered.
175,1,74,"""Giry, child, you're getting at us!"""
175,1,75,Thereupon little Giry began to cry.
175,1,76,"""I ought to have held my tongue -  - if mother ever came to know!  But I
was quite right, Joseph Buquet had no business to talk of things that
don't concern him -  - it will bring him bad luck -  - mother was saying so
last night -  -  -  - """
175,1,77,"There was a sound of hurried and heavy footsteps in the passage and a
breathless voice cried:"
175,1,78,"""Cecile!  Cecile!  Are you there?"""
175,1,79,"""It's mother's voice,"" said Jammes.  ""What's the matter?"""
175,1,80,"She opened the door.  A respectable lady, built on the lines of a
Pomeranian grenadier, burst into the dressing - room and dropped groaning
into a vacant arm - chair. Her eyes rolled madly in her brick - dust
colored face."
175,1,81,"""How awful!"" she said.  ""How awful!"""
175,1,82,"""What?  What?"""
175,1,83,"""Joseph Buquet!"""
175,1,84,"""What about him?"""
175,1,85,"""Joseph Buquet is dead!"""
175,1,86,"The room became filled with exclamations, with astonished outcries,
with scared requests for explanations."
175,1,87,"""Yes, he was found hanging in the third - floor cellar!"""
175,1,88,"""It's the ghost!"" little Giry blurted, as though in spite of herself;
but she at once corrected herself, with her hands pressed to her mouth:
""No, no! -  - I, didn't say it! -  - I didn't say it! -  -  -  - """
175,1,89,"All around her, her panic - stricken companions repeated under their
breaths:"
175,1,90,"""Yes -  - it must be the ghost!"""
175,1,91,Sorelli was very pale.
175,1,92,"""I shall never be able to recite my speech,"" she said."
175,1,93,"Ma Jammes gave her opinion, while she emptied a glass of liqueur that
happened to be standing on a table; the ghost must have something to do
with it."
175,1,94,"The truth is that no one ever knew how Joseph Buquet met his death.
The verdict at the inquest was ""natural suicide.""  In his Memoirs of
Manager, M. Moncharmin, one of the joint managers who succeeded MM.
Debienne and Poligny, describes the incident as follows:"
175,1,95,"""A grievous accident spoiled the little party which MM.  Debienne and
Poligny gave to celebrate their retirement.  I was in the manager's
office, when Mercier, the acting - manager, suddenly came darting in.  He
seemed half mad and told me that the body of a scene - shifter had been
found hanging in the third cellar under the stage, between a farm - house
and a scene from the Roi de Lahore.  I shouted:"
175,1,96,"""'Come and cut him down!'"
175,1,97,"""By the time I had rushed down the staircase and the Jacob's ladder,
the man was no longer hanging from his rope!"""
175,1,98,"So this is an event which M. Moncharmin thinks natural.  A man hangs at
the end of a rope; they go to cut him down; the rope has disappeared.
Oh, M. Moncharmin found a very simple explanation!  Listen to him:"
175,1,99,"""It was just after the ballet; and leaders and dancing - girls lost no
time in taking their precautions against the evil eye."""
175,1,100,"There you are!  Picture the corps de ballet scuttling down the Jacob's
ladder and dividing the suicide's rope among themselves in less time
than it takes to write!  When, on the other hand, I think of the exact
spot where the body was discovered -  - the third cellar underneath the
stage! -  - imagine that SOMEBODY must have been interested in seeing that
the rope disappeared after it had effected its purpose; and time will
show if I am wrong."
175,1,101,"The horrid news soon spread all over the Opera, where Joseph Buquet was
very popular.  The dressing - rooms emptied and the ballet - girls,
crowding around Sorelli like timid sheep around their shepherdess, made
for the foyer through the ill - lit passages and staircases, trotting as
fast as their little pink legs could carry them."
175,1,102,"[1] I have the anecdote, which is quite authentic, from M. Pedro
Gailhard himself, the late manager of the Opera."
175,2,1,"On the first landing, Sorelli ran against the Comte de Chagny, who was
coming up - stairs. The count, who was generally so calm, seemed greatly
excited."
175,2,2,"""I was just going to you,"" he said, taking off his hat.  ""Oh, Sorelli,
what an evening!  And Christine Daae:  what a triumph!"""
175,2,3,"""Impossible!"" said Meg Giry.  ""Six months ago, she used to sing like a
CROCK!  But do let us get by, my dear count,"" continues the brat, with
a saucy curtsey.  ""We are going to inquire after a poor man who was
found hanging by the neck."""
175,2,4,"Just then the acting - manager came fussing past and stopped when he
heard this remark."
175,2,5,"""What!"" he exclaimed roughly.  ""Have you girls heard already?  Well,
please forget about it for tonight -  - and above all don't let M. Debienne
and M. Poligny hear; it would upset them too much on their last day."""
175,2,6,"They all went on to the foyer of the ballet, which was already full of
people.  The Comte de Chagny was right; no gala performance ever
equalled this one.  All the great composers of the day had conducted
their own works in turns.  Faure and Krauss had sung; and, on that
evening, Christine Daae had revealed her true self, for the first time,
to the astonished and enthusiastic audience.  Gounod had conducted the
Funeral March of a Marionnette; Reyer, his beautiful overture to
Siguar; Saint Saens, the Danse Macabre and a Reverie Orientale;
Massenet, an unpublished Hungarian march; Guiraud, his Carnaval;
Delibes, the Valse Lente from Sylvia and the Pizzicati from Coppelia.
Mlle. Krauss had sung the bolero in the Vespri Siciliani; and Mlle.
Denise Bloch the drinking song in Lucrezia Borgia."
175,2,7,"But the real triumph was reserved for Christine Daae, who had begun by
singing a few passages from Romeo and Juliet.  It was the first time
that the young artist sang in this work of Gounod, which had not been
transferred to the Opera and which was revived at the Opera Comique
after it had been produced at the old Theatre Lyrique by Mme. Carvalho.
Those who heard her say that her voice, in these passages, was
seraphic; but this was nothing to the superhuman notes that she gave
forth in the prison scene and the final trio in FAUST, which she sang
in the place of La Carlotta, who was ill.  No one had ever heard or
seen anything like it."
175,2,8,"Daae revealed a new Margarita that night, a Margarita of a splendor, a
radiance hitherto unsuspected.  The whole house went mad, rising to its
feet, shouting, cheering, clapping, while Christine sobbed and fainted
in the arms of her fellow - singers and had to be carried to her
dressing - room. A few subscribers, however, protested.  Why had so great
a treasure been kept from them all that time?  Till then, Christine
Daae had played a good Siebel to Carlotta's rather too splendidly
material Margarita.  And it had needed Carlotta's incomprehensible and
inexcusable absence from this gala night for the little Daae, at a
moment's warning, to show all that she could do in a part of the
program reserved for the Spanish diva!  Well, what the subscribers
wanted to know was, why had Debienne and Poligny applied to Daae, when
Carlotta was taken ill?  Did they know of her hidden genius?  And, if
they knew of it, why had they kept it hidden?  And why had she kept it
hidden?  Oddly enough, she was not known to have a professor of singing
at that moment.  She had often said she meant to practise alone for the
future.  The whole thing was a mystery."
175,2,9,"The Comte de Chagny, standing up in his box, listened to all this
frenzy and took part in it by loudly applauding.  Philippe Georges
Marie Comte de Chagny was just forty - one years of age.  He was a great
aristocrat and a good - looking man, above middle height and with
attractive features, in spite of his hard forehead and his rather cold
eyes.  He was exquisitely polite to the women and a little haughty to
the men, who did not always forgive him for his successes in society.
He had an excellent heart and an irreproachable conscience.  On the
death of old Count Philibert, he became the head of one of the oldest
and most distinguished families in France, whose arms dated back to the
fourteenth century.  The Chagnys owned a great deal of property; and,
when the old count, who was a widower, died, it was no easy task for
Philippe to accept the management of so large an estate.  His two
sisters and his brother, Raoul, would not hear of a division and waived
their claim to their shares, leaving themselves entirely in Philippe's
hands, as though the right of primogeniture had never ceased to exist.
When the two sisters married, on the same day, they received their
portion from their brother, not as a thing rightfully belonging to
them, but as a dowry for which they thanked him."
175,2,10,"The Comtesse de Chagny, nee de Moerogis de La Martyniere, had died in
giving birth to Raoul, who was born twenty years after his elder
brother.  At the time of the old count's death, Raoul was twelve years
of age.  Philippe busied himself actively with the youngster's
education.  He was admirably assisted in this work first by his sisters
and afterward by an old aunt, the widow of a naval officer, who lived
at Brest and gave young Raoul a taste for the sea.  The lad entered the
Borda training - ship, finished his course with honors and quietly made
his trip round the world.  Thanks to powerful influence, he had just
been appointed a member of the official expedition on board the Requin,
which was to be sent to the Arctic Circle in search of the survivors of
the D'Artoi's expedition, of whom nothing had been heard for three
years.  Meanwhile, he was enjoying a long furlough which would not be
over for six months; and already the dowagers of the Faubourg
Saint - Germain were pitying the handsome and apparently delicate
stripling for the hard work in store for him."
175,2,11,"The shyness of the sailor - lad -  - I was almost saying his innocence -  - was
remarkable.  He seemed to have but just left the women's apron - strings.
As a matter of fact, petted as he was by his two sisters and his old
aunt, he had retained from this purely feminine education manners that
were almost candid and stamped with a charm that nothing had yet been
able to sully.  He was a little over twenty - one years of age and looked
eighteen.  He had a small, fair mustache, beautiful blue eyes and a
complexion like a girl's."
175,2,12,"Philippe spoiled Raoul.  To begin with, he was very proud of him and
pleased to foresee a glorious career for his junior in the navy in
which one of their ancestors, the famous Chagny de La Roche, had held
the rank of admiral.  He took advantage of the young man's leave of
absence to show him Paris, with all its luxurious and artistic
delights.  The count considered that, at Raoul's age, it is not good to
be too good.  Philippe himself had a character that was very
well - balanced in work and pleasure alike; his demeanor was always
faultless; and he was incapable of setting his brother a bad example.
He took him with him wherever he went.  He even introduced him to the
foyer of the ballet.  I know that the count was said to be ""on terms""
with Sorelli.  But it could hardly be reckoned as a crime for this
nobleman, a bachelor, with plenty of leisure, especially since his
sisters were settled, to come and spend an hour or two after dinner in
the company of a dancer, who, though not so very, very witty, had the
finest eyes that ever were seen!  And, besides, there are places where
a true Parisian, when he has the rank of the Comte de Chagny, is bound
to show himself; and at that time the foyer of the ballet at the Opera
was one of those places."
175,2,13,"Lastly, Philippe would perhaps not have taken his brother behind the
scenes of the Opera if Raoul had not been the first to ask him,
repeatedly renewing his request with a gentle obstinacy which the count
remembered at a later date."
175,2,14,"On that evening, Philippe, after applauding the Daae, turned to Raoul
and saw that he was quite pale."
175,2,15,"""Don't you see,"" said Raoul, ""that the woman's fainting?"""
175,2,16,"""You look like fainting yourself,"" said the count.  ""What's the matter?"""
175,2,17,But Raoul had recovered himself and was standing up.
175,2,18,"""Let's go and see,"" he said, ""she never sang like that before."""
175,2,19,"The count gave his brother a curious smiling glance and seemed quite
pleased. They were soon at the door leading from the house to the
stage.  Numbers of subscribers were slowly making their way through.
Raoul tore his gloves without knowing what he was doing and Philippe
had much too kind a heart to laugh at him for his impatience.  But he
now understood why Raoul was absent - minded when spoken to and why he
always tried to turn every conversation to the subject of the Opera."
175,2,20,"They reached the stage and pushed through the crowd of gentlemen,
scene - shifters, supers and chorus - girls, Raoul leading the way, feeling
that his heart no longer belonged to him, his face set with passion,
while Count Philippe followed him with difficulty and continued to
smile.  At the back of the stage, Raoul had to stop before the inrush
of the little troop of ballet - girls who blocked the passage which he
was trying to enter.  More than one chaffing phrase darted from little
made - up lips, to which he did not reply; and at last he was able to
pass, and dived into the semi - darkness of a corridor ringing with the
name of ""Daae!  Daae!""  The count was surprised to find that Raoul knew
the way.  He had never taken him to Christine's himself and came to the
conclusion that Raoul must have gone there alone while the count stayed
talking in the foyer with Sorelli, who often asked him to wait until it
was her time to ""go on"" and sometimes handed him the little gaiters in
which she ran down from her dressing - room to preserve the spotlessness
of her satin dancing - shoes and her flesh - colored tights.  Sorelli had
an excuse; she had lost her mother."
175,2,21,"Postponing his usual visit to Sorelli for a few minutes, the count
followed his brother down the passage that led to Daae's dressing - room
and saw that it had never been so crammed as on that evening, when the
whole house seemed excited by her success and also by her fainting fit.
For the girl had not yet come to; and the doctor of the theater had
just arrived at the moment when Raoul entered at his heels.  Christine,
therefore, received the first aid of the one, while opening her eyes in
the arms of the other.  The count and many more remained crowding in
the doorway."
175,2,22,"""Don't you think, Doctor, that those gentlemen had better clear the
room?"" asked Raoul coolly.  ""There's no breathing here."""
175,2,23,"""You're quite right,"" said the doctor."
175,2,24,"And he sent every one away, except Raoul and the maid, who looked at
Raoul with eyes of the most undisguised astonishment.  She had never
seen him before and yet dared not question him; and the doctor imagined
that the young man was only acting as he did because he had the right
to.  The viscount, therefore, remained in the room watching Christine
as she slowly returned to life, while even the joint managers, Debienne
and Poligny, who had come to offer their sympathy and congratulations,
found themselves thrust into the passage among the crowd of dandies.
The Comte de Chagny, who was one of those standing outside, laughed:"
175,2,25,"""Oh, the rogue, the rogue!""  And he added, under his breath: ""Those
youngsters with their school - girl airs!  So he's a Chagny after all!"""
175,2,26,"He turned to go to Sorelli's dressing - room, but met her on the way,
with her little troop of trembling ballet - girls, as we have seen."
175,2,27,"Meanwhile, Christine Daae uttered a deep sigh, which was answered by a
groan.  She turned her head, saw Raoul and started.  She looked at the
doctor, on whom she bestowed a smile, then at her maid, then at Raoul
again."
175,2,28,"""Monsieur,"" she said, in a voice not much above a whisper, ""who are
you?"""
175,2,29,"""Mademoiselle,"" replied the young man, kneeling on one knee and
pressing a fervent kiss on the diva's hand, ""I AM THE LITTLE BOY WHO
WENT INTO THE SEA TO RESCUE YOUR SCARF."""
175,2,30,"Christine again looked at the doctor and the maid; and all three began
to laugh."
175,2,31,Raoul turned very red and stood up.
175,2,32,"""Mademoiselle,"" he said, ""since you are pleased not to recognize me, I
should like to say something to you in private, something very
important."""
175,2,33,"""When I am better, do you mind?""  And her voice shook.  ""You have been
very good."""
175,2,34,"""Yes, you must go,"" said the doctor, with his pleasantest smile.
""Leave me to attend to mademoiselle."""
175,2,35,"""I am not ill now,"" said Christine suddenly, with strange and
unexpected energy."
175,2,36,She rose and passed her hand over her eyelids.
175,2,37,"""Thank you, Doctor.  I should like to be alone.  Please go away, all of
you.  Leave me.  I feel very restless this evening."""
175,2,38,"The doctor tried to make a short protest, but, perceiving the girl's
evident agitation, he thought the best remedy was not to thwart her.
And he went away, saying to Raoul, outside:"
175,2,39,"""She is not herself to - night. She is usually so gentle."""
175,2,40,"Then he said good night and Raoul was left alone.  The whole of this
part of the theater was now deserted.  The farewell ceremony was no
doubt taking place in the foyer of the ballet.  Raoul thought that Daae
might go to it and he waited in the silent solitude, even hiding in the
favoring shadow of a doorway.  He felt a terrible pain at his heart and
it was of this that he wanted to speak to Daae without delay."
175,2,41,"Suddenly the dressing - room door opened and the maid came out by
herself, carrying bundles.  He stopped her and asked how her mistress
was.  The woman laughed and said that she was quite well, but that he
must not disturb her, for she wished to be left alone.  And she passed
on.  One idea alone filled Raoul's burning brain:  of course, Daae
wished to be left alone FOR HIM!  Had he not told her that he wanted to
speak to her privately?"
175,2,42,"Hardly breathing, he went up to the dressing - room and, with his ear to
the door to catch her reply, prepared to knock.  But his hand dropped.
He had heard A MAN'S VOICE in the dressing - room, saying, in a curiously
masterful tone:"
175,2,43,"""Christine, you must love me!"""
175,2,44,"And Christine's voice, infinitely sad and trembling, as though
accompanied by tears, replied:"
175,2,45,"""How can you talk like that?  WHEN I SING ONLY FOR YOU!"""
175,2,46,"Raoul leaned against the panel to ease his pain.  His heart, which had
seemed gone for ever, returned to his breast and was throbbing loudly.
The whole passage echoed with its beating and Raoul's ears were
deafened.  Surely, if his heart continued to make such a noise, they
would hear it inside, they would open the door and the young man would
be turned away in disgrace.  What a position for a Chagny!  To be
caught listening behind a door!  He took his heart in his two hands to
make it stop."
175,2,47,"The man's voice spoke again:  ""Are you very tired?"""
175,2,48,"""Oh, to - night I gave you my soul and I am dead!""  Christine replied."
175,2,49,"""Your soul is a beautiful thing, child,"" replied the grave man's voice,
""and I thank you.  No emperor ever received so fair a gift.  THE ANGELS
WEPT TONIGHT."""
175,2,50,"Raoul heard nothing after that.  Nevertheless, he did not go away, but,
as though he feared lest he should be caught, he returned to his dark
corner, determined to wait for the man to leave the room.  At one and
the same time, he had learned what love meant, and hatred.  He knew
that he loved.  He wanted to know whom he hated.  To his great
astonishment, the door opened and Christine Daae appeared, wrapped in
furs, with her face hidden in a lace veil, alone.  She closed the door
behind her, but Raoul observed that she did not lock it.  She passed
him.  He did not even follow her with his eyes, for his eyes were fixed
on the door, which did not open again."
175,2,51,"When the passage was once more deserted, he crossed it, opened the door
of the dressing - room, went in and shut the door.  He found himself in
absolute darkness.  The gas had been turned out."
175,2,52,"""There is some one here!"" said Raoul, with his back against the closed
door, in a quivering voice.  ""What are you hiding for?"""
175,2,53,"All was darkness and silence.  Raoul heard only the sound of his own
breathing.  He quite failed to see that the indiscretion of his conduct
was exceeding all bounds."
175,2,54,"""You shan't leave this until I let you!"" he exclaimed.  ""If you don't
answer, you are a coward!  But I'll expose you!"""
175,2,55,"And he struck a match.  The blaze lit up the room.  There was no one in
the room!  Raoul, first turning the key in the door, lit the gas - jets.
He went into the dressing - closet, opened the cupboards, hunted about,
felt the walls with his moist hands.  Nothing!"
175,2,56,"""Look here!"" he said, aloud.  ""Am I going mad?"""
175,2,57,"He stood for ten minutes listening to the gas flaring in the silence of
the empty room; lover though he was, he did not even think of stealing
a ribbon that would have given him the perfume of the woman he loved.
He went out, not knowing what he was doing nor where he was going.  At
a given moment in his wayward progress, an icy draft struck him in the
face.  He found himself at the bottom of a staircase, down which,
behind him, a procession of workmen were carrying a sort of stretcher,
covered with a white sheet."
175,2,58,"""Which is the way out, please?"" he asked of one of the men."
175,2,59,"""Straight in front of you, the door is open.  But let us pass."""
175,2,60,"Pointing to the stretcher, he asked mechanically:  ""What's that?"""
175,2,61,The workmen answered:
175,2,62,"""'That' is Joseph Buquet, who was found in the third cellar, hanging
between a farm - house and a scene from the ROI DE LAHORE."""
175,2,63,"He took off his hat, fell back to make room for the procession and went
out."
175,3,1,"During this time, the farewell ceremony was taking place.  I have
already said that this magnificent function was being given on the
occasion of the retirement of M. Debienne and M. Poligny, who had
determined to ""die game,"" as we say nowadays.  They had been assisted
in the realization of their ideal, though melancholy, program by all
that counted in the social and artistic world of Paris.  All these
people met, after the performance, in the foyer of the ballet, where
Sorelli waited for the arrival of the retiring managers with a glass of
champagne in her hand and a little prepared speech at the tip of her
tongue.  Behind her, the members of the Corps de Ballet, young and old,
discussed the events of the day in whispers or exchanged discreet
signals with their friends, a noisy crowd of whom surrounded the
supper - tables arranged along the slanting floor."
175,3,2,"A few of the dancers had already changed into ordinary dress; but most
of them wore their skirts of gossamer gauze; and all had thought it the
right thing to put on a special face for the occasion:  all, that is,
except little Jammes, whose fifteen summers -  - happy age! -  - seemed already
to have forgotten the ghost and the death of Joseph Buquet.  She never
ceased to laugh and chatter, to hop about and play practical jokes,
until Mm. Debienne and Poligny appeared on the steps of the foyer, when
she was severely called to order by the impatient Sorelli."
175,3,3,"Everybody remarked that the retiring managers looked cheerful, as is
the Paris way.  None will ever be a true Parisian who has not learned
to wear a mask of gaiety over his sorrows and one of sadness, boredom
or indifference over his inward joy.  You know that one of your friends
is in trouble; do not try to console him: he will tell you that he is
already comforted; but, should he have met with good fortune, be
careful how you congratulate him:  he thinks it so natural that he is
surprised that you should speak of it.  In Paris, our lives are one
masked ball; and the foyer of the ballet is the last place in which two
men so ""knowing"" as M. Debienne and M. Poligny would have made the
mistake of betraying their grief, however genuine it might be.  And
they were already smiling rather too broadly upon Sorelli, who had
begun to recite her speech, when an exclamation from that little madcap
of a Jammes broke the smile of the managers so brutally that the
expression of distress and dismay that lay beneath it became apparent
to all eyes:"
175,3,4,"""The Opera ghost!"""
175,3,5,"Jammes yelled these words in a tone of unspeakable terror; and her
finger pointed, among the crowd of dandies, to a face so pallid, so
lugubrious and so ugly, with two such deep black cavities under the
straddling eyebrows, that the death's head in question immediately
scored a huge success."
175,3,6,"""The Opera ghost!  The Opera ghost!""  Everybody laughed and pushed his
neighbor and wanted to offer the Opera ghost a drink, but he was gone.
He had slipped through the crowd; and the others vainly hunted for him,
while two old gentlemen tried to calm little Jammes and while little
Giry stood screaming like a peacock."
175,3,7,"Sorelli was furious; she had not been able to finish her speech; the
managers, had kissed her, thanked her and run away as fast as the ghost
himself.  No one was surprised at this, for it was known that they were
to go through the same ceremony on the floor above, in the foyer of the
singers, and that finally they were themselves to receive their
personal friends, for the last time, in the great lobby outside the
managers' office, where a regular supper would be served."
175,3,8,"Here they found the new managers, M. Armand Moncharmin and M. Firmin
Richard, whom they hardly knew; nevertheless, they were lavish in
protestations of friendship and received a thousand flattering
compliments in reply, so that those of the guests who had feared that
they had a rather tedious evening in store for them at once put on
brighter faces.  The supper was almost gay and a particularly clever
speech of the representative of the government, mingling the glories of
the past with the successes of the future, caused the greatest
cordiality to prevail."
175,3,9,"The retiring managers had already handed over to their successors the
two tiny master - keys which opened all the doors -  - thousands of doors -  - of
the Opera house.  And those little keys, the object of general
curiosity, were being passed from hand to hand, when the attention of
some of the guests was diverted by their discovery, at the end of the
table, of that strange, wan and fantastic face, with the hollow eyes,
which had already appeared in the foyer of the ballet and been greeted
by little Jammes' exclamation:"
175,3,10,"""The Opera ghost!"""
175,3,11,"There sat the ghost, as natural as could be, except that he neither ate
nor drank.  Those who began by looking at him with a smile ended by
turning away their heads, for the sight of him at once provoked the
most funereal thoughts.  No one repeated the joke of the foyer, no one
exclaimed:"
175,3,12,"""There's the Opera ghost!"""
175,3,13,"He himself did not speak a word and his very neighbors could not have
stated at what precise moment he had sat down between them; but every
one felt that if the dead did ever come and sit at the table of the
living, they could not cut a more ghastly figure.  The friends of
Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin thought that this lean and skinny
guest was an acquaintance of Debienne's or Poligny's, while Debienne's
and Poligny's friends believed that the cadaverous individual belonged
to Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin's party."
175,3,14,"The result was that no request was made for an explanation; no
unpleasant remark; no joke in bad taste, which might have offended this
visitor from the tomb.  A few of those present who knew the story of
the ghost and the description of him given by the chief
scene - shifter -  - they did not know of Joseph Buquet's death -  - thought, in
their own minds, that the man at the end of the table might easily have
passed for him; and yet, according to the story, the ghost had no nose
and the person in question had.  But M. Moncharmin declares, in his
Memoirs, that the guest's nose was transparent:  ""long, thin and
transparent"" are his exact words.  I, for my part, will add that this
might very well apply to a false nose.  M. Moncharmin may have taken
for transparency what was only shininess.  Everybody knows that
orthopaedic science provides beautiful false noses for those who have
lost their noses naturally or as the result of an operation."
175,3,15,"Did the ghost really take a seat at the managers' supper - table that
night, uninvited?  And can we be sure that the figure was that of the
Opera ghost himself?  Who would venture to assert as much?  I mention
the incident, not because I wish for a second to make the reader
believe -  - or even to try to make him believe -  - that the ghost was capable
of such a sublime piece of impudence; but because, after all, the thing
is impossible."
175,3,16,"M. Armand Moncharmin, in chapter eleven of his Memoirs, says:"
175,3,17,"""When I think of this first evening, I can not separate the secret
confided to us by MM. Debienne and Poligny in their office from the
presence at our supper of that GHOSTLY person whom none of us knew."""
175,3,18,"What happened was this:  Mm. Debienne and Poligny, sitting at the
center of the table, had not seen the man with the death's head.
Suddenly he began to speak."
175,3,19,"""The ballet - girls are right,"" he said.  ""The death of that poor Buquet
is perhaps not so natural as people think."""
175,3,20,Debienne and Poligny gave a start.
175,3,21,"""Is Buquet dead?"" they cried."
175,3,22,"""Yes,"" replied the man, or the shadow of a man, quietly.  ""He was
found, this evening, hanging in the third cellar, between a farm - house
and a scene from the Roi de Lahore."""
175,3,23,"The two managers, or rather ex - managers, at once rose and stared
strangely at the speaker.  They were more excited than they need have
been, that is to say, more excited than any one need be by the
announcement of the suicide of a chief scene - shifter. They looked at
each other.  They, had both turned whiter than the table - cloth.  At
last, Debienne made a sign to Mm. Richard and Moncharmin; Poligny
muttered a few words of excuse to the guests; and all four went into
the managers' office.  I leave M. Moncharmin to complete the story.  In
his Memoirs, he says:"
175,3,24,"""Mm. Debienne and Poligny seemed to grow more and more excited, and
they appeared to have something very difficult to tell us.  First, they
asked us if we knew the man, sitting at the end of the table, who had
told them of the death of Joseph Buquet; and, when we answered in the
negative, they looked still more concerned.  They took the master - keys
from our hands, stared at them for a moment and advised us to have new
locks made, with the greatest secrecy, for the rooms, closets and
presses that we might wish to have hermetically closed.  They said this
so funnily that we began to laugh and to ask if there were thieves at
the Opera.  They replied that there was something worse, which was the
GHOST.  We began to laugh again, feeling sure that they were indulging
in some joke that was intended to crown our little entertainment.
Then, at their request, we became 'serious,' resolving to humor them
and to enter into the spirit of the game.  They told us that they never
would have spoken to us of the ghost, if they had not received formal
orders from the ghost himself to ask us to be pleasant to him and to
grant any request that he might make.  However, in their relief at
leaving a domain where that tyrannical shade held sway, they had
hesitated until the last moment to tell us this curious story, which
our skeptical minds were certainly not prepared to entertain.  But the
announcement of the death of Joseph Buquet had served them as a brutal
reminder that, whenever they had disregarded the ghost's wishes, some
fantastic or disastrous event had brought them to a sense of their
dependence."
175,3,25,"""During these unexpected utterances made in a tone of the most secret
and important confidence, I looked at Richard.  Richard, in his student
days, had acquired a great reputation for practical joking, and he
seemed to relish the dish which was being served up to him in his turn.
He did not miss a morsel of it, though the seasoning was a little
gruesome because of the death of Buquet.  He nodded his head sadly,
while the others spoke, and his features assumed the air of a man who
bitterly regretted having taken over the Opera, now that he knew that
there was a ghost mixed up in the business.  I could think of nothing
better than to give him a servile imitation of this attitude of
despair.  However, in spite of all our efforts, we could not, at the
finish, help bursting out laughing in the faces of MM. Debienne and
Poligny, who, seeing us pass straight from the gloomiest state of mind
to one of the most insolent merriment, acted as though they thought
that we had gone mad."
175,3,26,"""The joke became a little tedious; and Richard asked half - seriously and
half in jest:"
175,3,27,"""'But, after all, what does this ghost of yours want?'"
175,3,28,"""M. Poligny went to his desk and returned with a copy of the
memorandum - book. The memorandum - book begins with the well - known words
saying that 'the management of the Opera shall give to the performance
of the National Academy of Music the splendor that becomes the first
lyric stage in France' and ends with Clause 98, which says that the
privilege can be withdrawn if the manager infringes the conditions
stipulated in the memorandum - book.  This is followed by the conditions,
which are four in number."
175,3,29,"""The copy produced by M. Poligny was written in black ink and exactly
similar to that in our possession, except that, at the end, it
contained a paragraph in red ink and in a queer, labored handwriting,
as though it had been produced by dipping the heads of matches into the
ink, the writing of a child that has never got beyond the down - strokes
and has not learned to join its letters.  This paragraph ran, word for
word, as follows:"
175,3,30,"""'5. Or if the manager, in any month, delay for more than a fortnight
the payment of the allowance which he shall make to the Opera ghost, an
allowance of twenty thousand francs a month, say two hundred and forty
thousand francs a year.'"
175,3,31,"""M. Poligny pointed with a hesitating finger to this last clause, which
we certainly did not expect."
175,3,32,"""'Is this all?  Does he not want anything else?' asked Richard, with
the greatest coolness."
175,3,33,"""'Yes, he does,' replied Poligny."
175,3,34,"""And he turned over the pages of the memorandum - book until he came to
the clause specifying the days on which certain private boxes were to
be reserved for the free use of the president of the republic, the
ministers and so on.  At the end of this clause, a line had been added,
also in red ink:"
175,3,35,"""'Box Five on the grand tier shall be placed at the disposal of the
Opera ghost for every performance.'"
175,3,36,"""When we saw this, there was nothing else for us to do but to rise from
our chairs, shake our two predecessors warmly by the hand and
congratulate them on thinking of this charming little joke, which
proved that the old French sense of humor was never likely to become
extinct.  Richard added that he now understood why MM.  Debienne and
Poligny were retiring from the management of the National Academy of
Music.  Business was impossible with so unreasonable a ghost."
175,3,37,"""'Certainly, two hundred and forty thousand francs are not be picked up
for the asking,' said M. Poligny, without moving a muscle of his face.
'And have you considered what the loss over Box Five meant to us?  We
did not sell it once; and not only that, but we had to return the
subscription:  why, it's awful!  We really can't work to keep ghosts!
We prefer to go away!'"
175,3,38,"""'Yes,' echoed M. Debienne, 'we prefer to go away.  Let us go.'"""
175,3,39,"""And he stood up.  Richard said:  'But, after all all, it seems to me
that you were much too kind to the ghost.  If I had such a troublesome
ghost as that, I should not hesitate to have him arrested.'"
175,3,40,"""'But how?  Where?' they cried, in chorus.  'We have never seen him!'"
175,3,41,"""'But when he comes to his box?'"
175,3,42,"""'WE HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM IN HIS BOX.'"
175,3,43,"""'Then sell it.'"
175,3,44,"""'Sell the Opera ghost's box!  Well, gentlemen, try it.'"
175,3,45,"""Thereupon we all four left the office.  Richard and I had 'never
laughed so much in our lives.'"""
175,4,1,"Armand Moncharmin wrote such voluminous Memoirs during the fairly long
period of his co - management that we may well ask if he ever found time
to attend to the affairs of the Opera otherwise than by telling what
went on there.  M. Moncharmin did not know a note of music, but he
called the minister of education and fine arts by his Christian name,
had dabbled a little in society journalism and enjoyed a considerable
private income.  Lastly, he was a charming fellow and showed that he
was not lacking in intelligence, for, as soon as he made up his mind to
be a sleeping partner in the Opera, he selected the best possible
active manager and went straight to Firmin Richard."
175,4,2,"Firmin Richard was a very distinguished composer, who had published a
number of successful pieces of all kinds and who liked nearly every
form of music and every sort of musician.  Clearly, therefore, it was
the duty of every sort of musician to like M. Firmin Richard.  The only
things to be said against him were that he was rather masterful in his
ways and endowed with a very hasty temper."
175,4,3,"The first few days which the partners spent at the Opera were given
over to the delight of finding themselves the head of so magnificent an
enterprise; and they had forgotten all about that curious, fantastic
story of the ghost, when an incident occurred that proved to them that
the joke -  - if joke it were -  - was not over.  M. Firmin Richard reached his
office that morning at eleven o'clock. His secretary, M. Remy, showed
him half a dozen letters which he had not opened because they were
marked ""private."" One of the letters had at once attracted Richard's
attention not only because the envelope was addressed in red ink, but
because he seemed to have seen the writing before.  He soon remembered
that it was the red handwriting in which the memorandum - book had been
so curiously completed.  He recognized the clumsy childish hand.  He
opened the letter and read:"
175,4,4,DEAR MR.  MANAGER:
175,4,5,"I am sorry to have to trouble you at a time when you must be so very
busy, renewing important engagements, signing fresh ones and generally
displaying your excellent taste.  I know what you have done for
Carlotta, Sorelli and little Jammes and for a few others whose
admirable qualities of talent or genius you have suspected."
175,4,6,"Of course, when I use these words, I do not mean to apply them to La
Carlotta, who sings like a squirt and who ought never to have been
allowed to leave the Ambassadeurs and the Cafe Jacquin; nor to La
Sorelli, who owes her success mainly to the coach - builders; nor to
little Jammes, who dances like a calf in a field.  And I am not
speaking of Christine Daae either, though her genius is certain,
whereas your jealousy prevents her from creating any important part.
When all is said, you are free to conduct your little business as you
think best, are you not?"
175,4,7,"All the same, I should like to take advantage of the fact that you have
not yet turned Christine Daae out of doors by hearing her this evening
in the part of Siebel, as that of Margarita has been forbidden her
since her triumph of the other evening; and I will ask you not to
dispose of my box to - day nor on the FOLLOWING DAYS, for I can not end
this letter without telling you how disagreeably surprised I have been
once or twice, to hear, on arriving at the Opera, that my box had been
sold, at the box - office, by your orders."
175,4,8,"I did not protest, first, because I dislike scandal, and, second,
because I thought that your predecessors, MM. Debienne and Poligny, who
were always charming to me, had neglected, before leaving, to mention
my little fads to you.  I have now received a reply from those
gentlemen to my letter asking for an explanation, and this reply proves
that you know all about my Memorandum - Book and, consequently, that you
are treating me with outrageous contempt.  IF YOU WISH TO LIVE IN
PEACE, YOU MUST NOT BEGIN BY TAKING AWAY MY PRIVATE BOX."
175,4,9,"Believe me to be, dear Mr. Manager, without prejudice to these little
observations,"
175,4,10,"Your Most Humble and Obedient Servant,
OPERA GHOST."
175,4,11,"The letter was accompanied by a cutting from the agony - column of the
Revue Theatrale, which ran:"
175,4,12,"O. G. -  - There is no excuse for R. and M.  We told them and left your
memorandum - book in their hands.  Kind regards."
175,4,13,"M. Firmin Richard had hardly finished reading this letter when M.
Armand Moncharmin entered, carrying one exactly similar.  They looked
at each other and burst out laughing."
175,4,14,"""They are keeping up the joke,"" said M. Richard, ""but I don't call it
funny."""
175,4,15,"""What does it all mean?"" asked M. Moncharmin.  ""Do they imagine that,
because they have been managers of the Opera, we are going to let them
have a box for an indefinite period?"""
175,4,16,"""I am not in the mood to let myself be laughed at long,"" said Firmin
Richard."
175,4,17,"""It's harmless enough,"" observed Armand Moncharmin.  ""What is it they
really want?  A box for to - night?"""
175,4,18,"M. Firmin Richard told his secretary to send Box Five on the grand tier
to Mm. Debienne and Poligny, if it was not sold.  It was not.  It was
sent off to them.  Debienne lived at the corner of the Rue Scribe and
the Boulevard des Capucines; Poligny, in the Rue Auber.  O. Ghost's two
letters had been posted at the Boulevard des Capucines post - office, as
Moncharmin remarked after examining the envelopes."
175,4,19,"""You see!"" said Richard."
175,4,20,"They shrugged their shoulders and regretted that two men of that age
should amuse themselves with such childish tricks."
175,4,21,"""They might have been civil, for all that!"" said Moncharmin.  ""Did you
notice how they treat us with regard to Carlotta, Sorelli and Little
Jammes?"""
175,4,22,"""Why, my dear fellow, these two are mad with jealousy!  To think that
they went to the expense of, an advertisement in the Revue Theatrale!
Have they nothing better to do?"""
175,4,23,"""By the way,"" said Moncharmin, ""they seem to be greatly interested in
that little Christine Daae!"""
175,4,24,"""You know as well as I do that she has the reputation of being quite
good,"" said Richard."
175,4,25,"""Reputations are easily obtained,"" replied Moncharmin.  ""Haven't I a
reputation for knowing all about music?  And I don't know one key from
another."""
175,4,26,"""Don't be afraid:  you never had that reputation,"" Richard declared."
175,4,27,"Thereupon he ordered the artists to be shown in, who, for the last two
hours, had been walking up and down outside the door behind which fame
and fortune -  - or dismissal -  - awaited them."
175,4,28,"The whole day was spent in discussing, negotiating, signing or
cancelling contracts; and the two overworked managers went to bed
early, without so much as casting a glance at Box Five to see whether
M. Debienne and M. Poligny were enjoying the performance."
175,4,29,"Next morning, the managers received a card of thanks from the ghost:"
175,4,30,"DEAR, MR.  MANAGER:"
175,4,31,"Thanks.  Charming evening.  Daae exquisite.  Choruses want waking up.
Carlotta a splendid commonplace instrument.  Will write you soon for
the 240,000 francs, or 233,424 fr. 70 c., to be correct.  Mm. Debienne
and Poligny have sent me the 6,575 fr. 30 c. representing the first ten
days of my allowance for the current year; their privileges finished on
the evening of the tenth inst."
175,4,32,Kind regards.  O. G.
175,4,33,"On the other hand, there was a letter from Mm. Debienne and Poligny:"
175,4,34,GENTLEMEN:
175,4,35,"We are much obliged for your kind thought of us, but you will easily
understand that the prospect of again hearing Faust, pleasant though it
is to ex - managers of the Opera, can not make us forget that we have no
right to occupy Box Five on the grand tier, which is the exclusive
property of HIM of whom we spoke to you when we went through the
memorandum - book with you for the last time.  See Clause 98, final
paragraph."
175,4,36,"Accept, gentlemen, etc."
175,4,37,"""Oh, those fellows are beginning to annoy me!"" shouted Firmin Richard,
snatching up the letter."
175,4,38,And that evening Box Five was sold.
175,4,39,"The next morning, Mm. Richard and Moncharmin, on reaching their office,
found an inspector's report relating to an incident that had happened,
the night before, in Box Five.  I give the essential part of the report:"
175,4,40,"I was obliged to call in a municipal guard twice, this evening, to
clear Box Five on the grand tier, once at the beginning and once in the
middle of the second act.  The occupants, who arrived as the curtain
rose on the second act, created a regular scandal by their laughter and
their ridiculous observations.  There were cries of ""Hush!"" all around
them and the whole house was beginning to protest, when the box - keeper
came to fetch me.  I entered the box and said what I thought necessary.
The people did not seem to me to be in their right mind; and they made
stupid remarks.  I said that, if the noise was repeated, I should be
compelled to clear the box.  The moment I left, I heard the laughing
again, with fresh protests from the house.  I returned with a municipal
guard, who turned them out.  They protested, still laughing, saying
they would not go unless they had their money back.  At last, they
became quiet and I allowed them to enter the box again.  The laughter
at once recommenced; and, this time, I had them turned out definitely."
175,4,41,"""Send for the inspector,"" said Richard to his secretary, who had
already read the report and marked it with blue pencil."
175,4,42,"M. Remy, the secretary, had foreseen the order and called the inspector
at once."
175,4,43,"""Tell us what happened,"" said Richard bluntly."
175,4,44,The inspector began to splutter and referred to the report.
175,4,45,"""Well, but what were those people laughing at?"" asked Moncharmin."
175,4,46,"""They must have been dining, sir, and seemed more inclined to lark
about than to listen to good music.  The moment they entered the box,
they came out again and called the box - keeper, who asked them what they
wanted.  They said, 'Look in the box:  there's no one there, is there?'
'No,' said the woman.  'Well,' said they, 'when we went in, we heard a
voice saying THAT THE BOX WAS TAKEN!'"""
175,4,47,"M. Moncharmin could not help smiling as he looked at M. Richard; but M.
Richard did not smile.  He himself had done too much in that way in his
time not to recognize, in the inspector's story, all the marks of one
of those practical jokes which begin by amusing and end by enraging the
victims.  The inspector, to curry favor with M. Moncharmin, who was
smiling, thought it best to give a smile too.  A most unfortunate
smile!  M. Richard glared at his subordinate, who thenceforth made it
his business to display a face of utter consternation."
175,4,48,"""However, when the people arrived,"" roared Richard, ""there was no one
in the box, was there?"""
175,4,49,"""Not a soul, sir, not a soul!  Nor in the box on the right, nor in the
box on the left: not a soul, sir, I swear!  The box - keeper told it me
often enough, which proves that it was all a joke."""
175,4,50,"""Oh, you agree, do you?"" said Richard.  ""You agree!  It's a joke!  And
you think it funny, no doubt?"""
175,4,51,"""I think it in very bad taste, sir."""
175,4,52,"""And what did the box - keeper say?"""
175,4,53,"""Oh, she just said that it was the Opera ghost.  That's all she said!"""
175,4,54,"And the inspector grinned.  But he soon found that he had made a
mistake in grinning, for the words had no sooner left his mouth than M.
Richard, from gloomy, became furious."
175,4,55,"""Send for the box - keeper!"" he shouted.  ""Send for her!  This minute!
This minute!  And bring her in to me here!  And turn all those people
out!"""
175,4,56,"The inspector tried to protest, but Richard closed his mouth with an
angry order to hold his tongue.  Then, when the wretched man's lips
seemed shut for ever, the manager commanded him to open them once more."
175,4,57,"""Who is this 'Opera ghost?'"" he snarled."
175,4,58,"But the inspector was by this time incapable of speaking a word.  He
managed to convey, by a despairing gesture, that he knew nothing about
it, or rather that he did not wish to know."
175,4,59,"""Have you ever seen him, have you seen the Opera ghost?"""
175,4,60,"The inspector, by means of a vigorous shake of the head, denied ever
having seen the ghost in question."
175,4,61,"""Very well!"" said M. Richard coldly."
175,4,62,"The inspector's eyes started out of his head, as though to ask why the
manager had uttered that ominous ""Very well!"""
175,4,63,"""Because I'm going to settle the account of any one who has not seen
him!"" explained the manager.  ""As he seems to be everywhere, I can't
have people telling me that they see him nowhere.  I like people to
work for me when I employ them!"""
175,4,64,"Having said this, M. Richard paid no attention to the inspector and
discussed various matters of business with his acting - manager, who had
entered the room meanwhile.  The inspector thought he could go and was
gently -  - oh, so gently! -  - sidling toward the door, when M. Richard nailed
the man to the floor with a thundering:"
175,4,65,"""Stay where you are!"""
175,4,66,"M. Remy had sent for the box - keeper to the Rue de Provence, close to
the Opera, where she was engaged as a porteress.  She soon made her
appearance."
175,4,67,"""What's your name?"""
175,4,68,"""Mme. Giry.  You know me well enough, sir; I'm the mother of little
Giry, little Meg, what!"""
175,4,69,"This was said in so rough and solemn a tone that, for a moment, M.
Richard was impressed.  He looked at Mme. Giry, in her faded shawl, her
worn shoes, her old taffeta dress and dingy bonnet.  It was quite
evident from the manager's attitude, that he either did not know or
could not remember having met Mme. Giry, nor even little Giry, nor even
""little Meg!""  But Mme. Giry's pride was so great that the celebrated
box - keeper imagined that everybody knew her."
175,4,70,"""Never heard of her!"" the manager declared.  ""But that's no reason,
Mme. Giry, why I shouldn't ask you what happened last night to make you
and the inspector call in a municipal guard."""
175,4,71,"""I was just wanting to see you, sir, and talk to you about it, so that
you mightn't have the same unpleasantness as M. Debienne and M.
Poligny.  They wouldn't listen to me either, at first."""
175,4,72,"""I'm not asking you about all that.  I'm asking what happened last
night."""
175,4,73,"Mme. Giry turned purple with indignation.  Never had she been spoken to
like that.  She rose as though to go, gathering up the folds of her
skirt and waving the feathers of her dingy bonnet with dignity, but,
changing her mind, she sat down again and said, in a haughty voice:"
175,4,74,"""I'll tell you what happened.  The ghost was annoyed again!"""
175,4,75,"Thereupon, as M. Richard was on the point of bursting out, M.
Moncharmin interfered and conducted the interrogatory, whence it
appeared that Mme. Giry thought it quite natural that a voice should be
heard to say that a box was taken, when there was nobody in the box.
She was unable to explain this phenomenon, which was not new to her,
except by the intervention of the ghost.  Nobody could see the ghost in
his box, but everybody could hear him.  She had often heard him; and
they could believe her, for she always spoke the truth.  They could ask
M. Debienne and M. Poligny, and anybody who knew her; and also M.
Isidore Saack, who had had a leg broken by the ghost!"
175,4,76,"""Indeed!"" said Moncharmin, interrupting her.  ""Did the ghost break poor
Isidore Saack's leg?"""
175,4,77,"Mme. Giry opened her eyes with astonishment at such ignorance.
However, she consented to enlighten those two poor innocents.  The
thing had happened in M. Debienne and M. Poligny's time, also in Box
Five and also during a performance of FAUST.  Mme. Giry coughed,
cleared her throat -  - it sounded as though she were preparing to sing the
whole of Gounod's score -  - and began:"
175,4,78,"""It was like this, sir.  That night, M. Maniera and his lady, the
jewelers in the Rue Mogador, were sitting in the front of the box, with
their great friend, M. Isidore Saack, sitting behind Mme. Maniera.
Mephistopheles was singing"" -  - Mme. Giry here burst into song
herself -  - ""'Catarina, while you play at sleeping,' and then M. Maniera
heard a voice in his right ear (his wife was on his left) saying, 'Ha,
ha!  Julie's not playing at sleeping!'  His wife happened to be called
Julie.  So.  M. Maniera turns to the right to see who was talking to
him like that.  Nobody there!  He rubs his ear and asks himself, if
he's dreaming.  Then Mephistopheles went on with his serenade...  But,
perhaps I'm boring you gentlemen?"""
175,4,79,"""No, no, go on."""
175,4,80,"""You are too good, gentlemen,"" with a smirk.  ""Well, then,
Mephistopheles went on with his serenade"" -  - Mme. Giry, burst into song
again -  - ""'Saint, unclose thy portals holy and accord the bliss, to a
mortal bending lowly, of a pardon - kiss.' And then M. Maniera again
hears the voice in his right ear, saying, this time, 'Ha, ha!  Julie
wouldn't mind according a kiss to Isidore!'  Then he turns round again,
but, this time, to the left; and what do you think he sees?  Isidore,
who had taken his lady's hand and was covering it with kisses through
the little round place in the glove -  - like this, gentlemen"" -  - rapturously
kissing the bit of palm left bare in the middle of her thread gloves.
""Then they had a lively time between them!  Bang!  Bang!  M. Maniera,
who was big and strong, like you, M. Richard, gave two blows to M.
Isidore Saack, who was small and weak like M. Moncharmin, saving his
presence.  There was a great uproar.  People in the house shouted,
'That will do!  Stop them!  He'll kill him!'  Then, at last, M. Isidore
Saack managed to run away."""
175,4,81,"""Then the ghost had not broken his leg?"" asked M. Moncharmin, a little
vexed that his figure had made so little impression on Mme. Giry."
175,4,82,"""He did break it for him, sir,"" replied Mme. Giry haughtily.  ""He broke
it for him on the grand staircase, which he ran down too fast, sir, and
it will be long before the poor gentleman will be able to go up it
again!"""
175,4,83,"""Did the ghost tell you what he said in M. Maniera's right ear?"" asked
M. Moncharmin, with a gravity which he thought exceedingly humorous."
175,4,84,"""No, sir, it was M. Maniera himself.  So -  -  -  - """
175,4,85,"""But you have spoken to the ghost, my good lady?"""
175,4,86,"""As I'm speaking to you now, my good sir!""  Mme. Giry replied."
175,4,87,"""And, when the ghost speaks to you, what does he say?"""
175,4,88,"""Well, he tells me to bring him a footstool!"""
175,4,89,"This time, Richard burst out laughing, as did Moncharmin and Remy, the
secretary.  Only the inspector, warned by experience, was careful not
to laugh, while Mme. Giry ventured to adopt an attitude that was
positively threatening."
175,4,90,"""Instead of laughing,"" she cried indignantly, ""you'd do better to do as
M. Poligny did, who found out for himself."""
175,4,91,"""Found out about what?"" asked Moncharmin, who had never been so much
amused in his life."
175,4,92,"""About the ghost, of course! ... Look here ..."""
175,4,93,"She suddenly calmed herself, feeling that this was a solemn moment in
her life:"
175,4,94,"""LOOK HERE,"" she repeated.  ""They were playing La Juive.  M. Poligny
thought he would watch the performance from the ghost's box... Well,
when Leopold cries, 'Let us fly!' -  - you know -  - and Eleazer stops them and
says, 'Whither go ye?' ... well, M. Poligny -  - I was watching him from
the back of the next box, which was empty -  - M. Poligny got up and walked
out quite stiffly, like a statue, and before I had time to ask him,
'Whither go ye?' like Eleazer, he was down the staircase, but without
breaking his leg."
175,4,95,"""Still, that doesn't let us know how the Opera ghost came to ask you
for a footstool,"" insisted M. Moncharmin."
175,4,96,"""Well, from that evening, no one tried to take the ghost's private box
from him.  The manager gave orders that he was to have it at each
performance.  And, whenever he came, he asked me for a footstool."""
175,4,97,"""Tut, tut!  A ghost asking for a footstool!  Then this ghost of yours
is a woman?"""
175,4,98,"""No, the ghost is a man."""
175,4,99,"""How do you know?"""
175,4,100,"""He has a man's voice, oh, such a lovely man's voice!  This is what
happens:  When he comes to the opera, it's usually in the middle of the
first act.  He gives three little taps on the door of Box Five.  The
first time I heard those three taps, when I knew there was no one in
the box, you can think how puzzled I was!  I opened the door, listened,
looked; nobody!  And then I heard a voice say, 'Mme. Jules' my poor
husband's name was Jules -  - 'a footstool, please.' Saving your presence,
gentlemen, it made me feel all - overish like.  But the voice went on,
'Don't be frightened, Mme. Jules, I'm the Opera ghost!'  And the voice
was so soft and kind that I hardly felt frightened.  THE VOICE WAS
SITTING IN THE CORNER CHAIR, ON THE RIGHT, IN THE FRONT ROW."""
175,4,101,"""Was there any one in the box on the right of Box Five?"" asked
Moncharmin."
175,4,102,"""No; Box Seven, and Box Three, the one on the left, were both empty.
The curtain had only just gone up."""
175,4,103,"""And what did you do?"""
175,4,104,"""Well, I brought the footstool.  Of course, it wasn't for himself he
wanted it, but for his lady!  But I never heard her nor saw her."""
175,4,105,"""Eh?  What?  So now the ghost is married!""  The eyes of the two
managers traveled from Mme. Giry to the inspector, who, standing behind
the box - keeper, was waving his arms to attract their attention.  He
tapped his forehead with a distressful forefinger, to convey his
opinion that the widow Jules Giry was most certainly mad, a piece of
pantomime which confirmed M. Richard in his determination to get rid of
an inspector who kept a lunatic in his service.  Meanwhile, the worthy
lady went on about her ghost, now painting his generosity:"
175,4,106,"""At the end of the performance, he always gives me two francs,
sometimes five, sometimes even ten, when he has been many days without
coming.  Only, since people have begun to annoy him again, he gives me
nothing at all."
175,4,107,"""Excuse me, my good woman,"" said Moncharmin, while Mme. Giry tossed the
feathers in her dingy hat at this persistent familiarity, ""excuse me,
how does the ghost manage to give you your two francs?"""
175,4,108,"""Why, he leaves them on the little shelf in the box, of course.  I find
them with the program, which I always give him.  Some evenings, I find
flowers in the box, a rose that must have dropped from his lady's
bodice ... for he brings a lady with him sometimes; one day, they left
a fan behind them."""
175,4,109,"""Oh, the ghost left a fan, did he?  And what did you do with it?"""
175,4,110,"""Well, I brought it back to the box next night."""
175,4,111,Here the inspector's voice was raised.
175,4,112,"""You've broken the rules; I shall have to fine you, Mme. Giry."""
175,4,113,"""Hold your tongue, you fool!"" muttered M. Firmin Richard."
175,4,114,"""You brought back the fan.  And then?"""
175,4,115,"""Well, then, they took it away with them, sir; it was not there at the
end of the performance; and in its place they left me a box of English
sweets, which I'm very fond of.  That's one of the ghost's pretty
thoughts."""
175,4,116,"""That will do, Mme. Giry.  You can go."""
175,4,117,"When Mme. Giry had bowed herself out, with the dignity that never
deserted her, the manager told the inspector that they had decided to
dispense with that old madwoman's services; and, when he had gone in
his turn, they instructed the acting - manager to make up the inspector's
accounts.  Left alone, the managers told each other of the idea which
they both had in mind, which was that they should look into that little
matter of Box Five themselves."
175,5,1,"Christine Daae, owing to intrigues to which I will return later, did
not immediately continue her triumph at the Opera.  After the famous
gala night, she sang once at the Duchess de Zurich's; but this was the
last occasion on which she was heard in private.  She refused, without
plausible excuse, to appear at a charity concert to which she had
promised her assistance.  She acted throughout as though she were no
longer the mistress of her own destiny and as though she feared a fresh
triumph."
175,5,2,"She knew that the Comte de Chagny, to please his brother, had done his
best on her behalf with M. Richard; and she wrote to thank him and also
to ask him to cease speaking in her favor.  Her reason for this curious
attitude was never known.  Some pretended that it was due to
overweening pride; others spoke of her heavenly modesty.  But people on
the stage are not so modest as all that; and I think that I shall not
be far from the truth if I ascribe her action simply to fear.  Yes, I
believe that Christine Daae was frightened by what had happened to her.
I have a letter of Christine's (it forms part of the Persian's
collection), relating to this period, which suggests a feeling of
absolute dismay:"
175,5,3,"""I don't know myself when I sing,"" writes the poor child."
175,5,4,"She showed herself nowhere; and the Vicomte de Chagny tried in vain to
meet her.  He wrote to her, asking to call upon her, but despaired of
receiving a reply when, one morning, she sent him the following note:"
175,5,5,MONSIEUR:
175,5,6,"I have not forgotten the little boy who went into the sea to rescue my
scarf.  I feel that I must write to you to - day, when I am going to
Perros, in fulfilment of a sacred duty.  To - morrow is the anniversary
of the death of my poor father, whom you knew and who was very fond of
you.  He is buried there, with his violin, in the graveyard of the
little church, at the bottom of the slope where we used to play as
children, beside the road where, when we were a little bigger, we said
good - by for the last time."
175,5,7,"The Vicomte de Chagny hurriedly consulted a railway guide, dressed as
quickly as he could, wrote a few lines for his valet to take to his
brother and jumped into a cab which brought him to the Gare
Montparnasse just in time to miss the morning train.  He spent a dismal
day in town and did not recover his spirits until the evening, when he
was seated in his compartment in the Brittany express.  He read
Christine's note over and over again, smelling its perfume, recalling
the sweet pictures of his childhood, and spent the rest of that tedious
night journey in feverish dreams that began and ended with Christine
Daae.  Day was breaking when he alighted at Lannion.  He hurried to the
diligence for Perros - Guirec.  He was the only passenger.  He questioned
the driver and learned that, on the evening of the previous day, a
young lady who looked like a Parisian had gone to Perros and put up at
the inn known as the Setting Sun."
175,5,8,"The nearer he drew to her, the more fondly he remembered the story of
the little Swedish singer.  Most of the details are still unknown to
the public."
175,5,9,"There was once, in a little market - town not far from Upsala, a peasant
who lived there with his family, digging the earth during the week and
singing in the choir on Sundays.  This peasant had a little daughter to
whom he taught the musical alphabet before she knew how to read.
Daae's father was a great musician, perhaps without knowing it.  Not a
fiddler throughout the length and breadth of Scandinavia played as he
did.  His reputation was widespread and he was always invited to set
the couples dancing at weddings and other festivals.  His wife died
when Christine was entering upon her sixth year.  Then the father, who
cared only for his daughter and his music, sold his patch of ground and
went to Upsala in search of fame and fortune.  He found nothing but
poverty."
175,5,10,"He returned to the country, wandering from fair to fair, strumming his
Scandinavian melodies, while his child, who never left his side,
listened to him in ecstasy or sang to his playing.  One day, at Ljimby
Fair, Professor Valerius heard them and took them to Gothenburg.  He
maintained that the father was the first violinist in the world and
that the daughter had the making of a great artist.  Her education and
instruction were provided for.  She made rapid progress and charmed
everybody with her prettiness, her grace of manner and her genuine
eagerness to please."
175,5,11,"When Valerius and his wife went to settle in France, they took Daae and
Christine with them.  ""Mamma"" Valerius treated Christine as her
daughter.  As for Daae, he began to pine away with homesickness.  He
never went out of doors in Paris, but lived in a sort of dream which he
kept up with his violin.  For hours at a time, he remained locked up in
his bedroom with his daughter, fiddling and singing, very, very softly.
Sometimes Mamma Valerius would come and listen behind the door, wipe
away a tear and go down - stairs again on tiptoe, sighing for her
Scandinavian skies."
175,5,12,"Daae seemed not to recover his strength until the summer, when the
whole family went to stay at Perros - Guirec, in a far - away corner of
Brittany, where the sea was of the same color as in his own country.
Often he would play his saddest tunes on the beach and pretend that the
sea stopped its roaring to listen to them.  And then he induced Mamma
Valerius to indulge a queer whim of his.  At the time of the ""pardons,""
or Breton pilgrimages, the village festival and dances, he went off
with his fiddle, as in the old days, and was allowed to take his
daughter with him for a week.  They gave the smallest hamlets music to
last them for a year and slept at night in a barn, refusing a bed at
the inn, lying close together on the straw, as when they were so poor
in Sweden.  At the same time, they were very neatly dressed, made no
collection, refused the halfpence offered them; and the people around
could not understand the conduct of this rustic fiddler, who tramped
the roads with that pretty child who sang like an angel from Heaven.
They followed them from village to village."
175,5,13,"One day, a little boy, who was out with his governess, made her take a
longer walk than he intended, for he could not tear himself from the
little girl whose pure, sweet voice seemed to bind him to her.  They
came to the shore of an inlet which is still called Trestraou, but
which now, I believe, harbors a casino or something of the sort.  At
that time, there was nothing but sky and sea and a stretch of golden
beach.  Only, there was also a high wind, which blew Christine's scarf
out to sea.  Christine gave a cry and put out her arms, but the scarf
was already far on the waves.  Then she heard a voice say:"
175,5,14,"""It's all right, I'll go and fetch your scarf out of the sea."""
175,5,15,"And she saw a little boy running fast, in spite of the outcries and the
indignant protests of a worthy lady in black.  The little boy ran into
the sea, dressed as he was, and brought her back her scarf.  Boy and
scarf were both soaked through.  The lady in black made a great fuss,
but Christine laughed merrily and kissed the little boy, who was none
other than the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, staying at Lannion with his
aunt."
175,5,16,"During the season, they saw each other and played together almost every
day.  At the aunt's request, seconded by Professor Valerius, Daae
consented to give the young viscount some violin lessons.  In this way,
Raoul learned to love the same airs that had charmed Christine's
childhood.  They also both had the same calm and dreamy little cast of
mind.  They delighted in stories, in old Breton legends; and their
favorite sport was to go and ask for them at the cottage - doors, like
beggars:"
175,5,17,"""Ma'am ..."" or, ""Kind gentleman ... have you a little story to tell us,
please?"""
175,5,18,"And it seldom happened that they did not have one ""given"" them; for
nearly every old Breton grandame has, at least once in her life, seen
the ""korrigans"" dance by moonlight on the heather."
175,5,19,"But their great treat was, in the twilight, in the great silence of the
evening, after the sun had set in the sea, when Daae came and sat down
by them on the roadside and, in a low voice, as though fearing lest he
should frighten the ghosts whom he evoked, told them the legends of the
land of the North.  And, the moment he stopped, the children would ask
for more."
175,5,20,There was one story that began:
175,5,21,"""A king sat in a little boat on one of those deep, still lakes that
open like a bright eye in the midst of the Norwegian mountains ..."""
175,5,22,And another:
175,5,23,"""Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing.  Her hair was golden
as the sun's rays and her soul as clear and blue as her eyes.  She
wheedled her mother, was kind to her doll, took great care of her frock
and her little red shoes and her fiddle, but most of all loved, when
she went to sleep, to hear the Angel of Music."""
175,5,24,"While the old man told this story, Raoul looked at Christine's blue
eyes and golden hair; and Christine thought that Lotte was very lucky
to hear the Angel of Music when she went to sleep.  The Angel of Music
played a part in all Daddy Daae's tales; and he maintained that every
great musician, every great artist received a visit from the Angel at
least once in his life.  Sometimes the Angel leans over their cradle,
as happened to Lotte, and that is how there are little prodigies who
play the fiddle at six better than men at fifty, which, you must admit,
is very wonderful.  Sometimes, the Angel comes much later, because the
children are naughty and won't learn their lessons or practise their
scales.  And, sometimes, he does not come at all, because the children
have a bad heart or a bad conscience."
175,5,25,"No one ever sees the Angel; but he is heard by those who are meant to
hear him.  He often comes when they least expect him, when they are sad
and disheartened.  Then their ears suddenly perceive celestial
harmonies, a divine voice, which they remember all their lives.
Persons who are visited by the Angel quiver with a thrill unknown to
the rest of mankind.  And they can not touch an instrument, or open
their mouths to sing, without producing sounds that put all other human
sounds to shame.  Then people who do not know that the Angel has
visited those persons say that they have genius."
175,5,26,"Little Christine asked her father if he had heard the Angel of Music.
But Daddy Daae shook his head sadly; and then his eyes lit up, as he
said:"
175,5,27,"""You will hear him one day, my child!  When I am in Heaven, I will send
him to you!"""
175,5,28,Daddy was beginning to cough at that time.
175,5,29,"Three years later, Raoul and Christine met again at Perros.  Professor
Valerius was dead, but his widow remained in France with Daddy Daae and
his daughter, who continued to play the violin and sing, wrapping in
their dream of harmony their kind patroness, who seemed henceforth to
live on music alone.  The young man, as he now was, had come to Perros
on the chance of finding them and went straight to the house in which
they used to stay.  He first saw the old man; and then Christine
entered, carrying the tea - tray. She flushed at the sight of Raoul, who
went up to her and kissed her.  She asked him a few questions,
performed her duties as hostess prettily, took up the tray again and
left the room.  Then she ran into the garden and took refuge on a
bench, a prey to feelings that stirred her young heart for the first
time.  Raoul followed her and they talked till the evening, very shyly.
They were quite changed, cautious as two diplomatists, and told each
other things that had nothing to do with their budding sentiments.
When they took leave of each other by the roadside, Raoul, pressing a
kiss on Christine's trembling hand, said:"
175,5,30,"""Mademoiselle, I shall never forget you!"""
175,5,31,"And he went away regretting his words, for he knew that Christine could
not be the wife of the Vicomte de Chagny."
175,5,32,"As for Christine, she tried not to think of him and devoted herself
wholly to her art.  She made wonderful progress and those who heard her
prophesied that she would be the greatest singer in the world.
Meanwhile, the father died; and, suddenly, she seemed to have lost,
with him, her voice, her soul and her genius.  She retained just, but
only just, enough of this to enter the CONSERVATOIRE, where she did not
distinguish herself at all, attending the classes without enthusiasm
and taking a prize only to please old Mamma Valerius, with whom she
continued to live."
175,5,33,"The first time that Raoul saw Christine at the Opera, he was charmed by
the girl's beauty and by the sweet images of the past which it evoked,
but was rather surprised at the negative side of her art.  He returned
to listen to her.  He followed her in the wings.  He waited for her
behind a Jacob's ladder.  He tried to attract her attention.  More than
once, he walked after her to the door of her box, but she did not see
him.  She seemed, for that matter, to see nobody.  She was all
indifference.  Raoul suffered, for she was very beautiful and he was
shy and dared not confess his love, even to himself.  And then came the
lightning - flash of the gala performance: the heavens torn asunder and
an angel's voice heard upon earth for the delight of mankind and the
utter capture of his heart."
175,5,34,"And then ... and then there was that man's voice behind the door -  - ""You
must love me!"" -  - and no one in the room..."
175,5,35,"Why did she laugh when he reminded her of the incident of the scarf?
Why did she not recognize him?  And why had she written to him? ..."
175,5,36,"Perros was reached at last.  Raoul walked into the smoky sitting - room
of the Setting Sun and at once saw Christine standing before him,
smiling and showing no astonishment."
175,5,37,"""So you have come,"" she said.  ""I felt that I should find you here,
when I came back from mass.  Some one told me so, at the church."""
175,5,38,"""Who?"" asked Raoul, taking her little hand in his."
175,5,39,"""Why, my poor father, who is dead."""
175,5,40,There was a silence; and then Raoul asked:
175,5,41,"""Did your father tell you that I love you, Christine, and that I can
not live without you?"""
175,5,42,"Christine blushed to the eyes and turned away her head.  In a trembling
voice, she said:"
175,5,43,"""Me?  You are dreaming, my friend!"""
175,5,44,"And she burst out laughing, to put herself in countenance."
175,5,45,"""Don't laugh, Christine; I am quite serious,"" Raoul answered."
175,5,46,"And she replied gravely:  ""I did not make you come to tell me such
things as that."""
175,5,47,"""You 'made me come,' Christine; you knew that your letter would not
leave me indignant and that I should hasten to Perros.  How can you
have thought that, if you did not think I loved you?"""
175,5,48,"""I thought you would remember our games here, as children, in which my
father so often joined.  I really don't know what I thought...  Perhaps
I was wrong to write to you ... This anniversary and your sudden
appearance in my room at the Opera, the other evening, reminded me of
the time long past and made me write to you as the little girl that I
then was..."""
175,5,49,"There was something in Christine's attitude that seemed to Raoul not
natural.  He did not feel any hostility in her; far from it: the
distressed affection shining in her eyes told him that.  But why was
this affection distressed?  That was what he wished to know and what
was irritating him."
175,5,50,"""When you saw me in your dressing - room, was that the first time you
noticed me, Christine?"""
175,5,51,She was incapable of lying.
175,5,52,"""No,"" she said, ""I had seen you several times in your brother's box.
And also on the stage."""
175,5,53,"""I thought so!"" said Raoul, compressing his lips.  ""But then why, when
you saw me in your room, at your feet, reminding you that I had rescued
your scarf from the sea, why did you answer as though you did not know
me and also why did you laugh?"""
175,5,54,"The tone of these questions was so rough that Christine stared at Raoul
without replying.  The young man himself was aghast at the sudden
quarrel which he had dared to raise at the very moment when he had
resolved to speak words of gentleness, love and submission to
Christine.  A husband, a lover with all rights, would talk no
differently to a wife, a mistress who had offended him.  But he had
gone too far and saw no other way out of the ridiculous position than
to behave odiously."
175,5,55,"""You don't answer!"" he said angrily and unhappily.  ""Well, I will
answer for you.  It was because there was some one in the room who was
in your way, Christine, some one that you did not wish to know that you
could be interested in any one else!"""
175,5,56,"""If any one was in my way, my friend,"" Christine broke in coldly, ""if
any one was in my way, that evening, it was yourself, since I told you
to leave the room!"""
175,5,57,"""Yes, so that you might remain with the other!"""
175,5,58,"""What are you saying, monsieur?"" asked the girl excitedly.  ""And to
what other do you refer?"""
175,5,59,"""To the man to whom you said, 'I sing only for you! ... to - night I gave
you my soul and I am dead!'"""
175,5,60,"Christine seized Raoul's arm and clutched it with a strength which no
one would have suspected in so frail a creature."
175,5,61,"""Then you were listening behind the door?"""
175,5,62,"""Yes, because I love you everything ... And I heard everything ..."""
175,5,63,"""You heard what?"""
175,5,64,"And the young girl, becoming strangely calm, released Raoul's arm."
175,5,65,"""He said to you, 'Christine, you must love me!'"""
175,5,66,"At these words, a deathly pallor spread over Christine's face, dark
rings formed round her eyes, she staggered and seemed on the point of
swooning.  Raoul darted forward, with arms outstretched, but Christine
had overcome her passing faintness and said, in a low voice:"
175,5,67,"""Go on!  Go on!  Tell me all you heard!"""
175,5,68,"At an utter loss to understand, Raoul answered:  ""I heard him reply,
when you said you had given him your soul, 'Your soul is a beautiful
thing, child, and I thank you.  No emperor ever received so fair a
gift.  The angels wept tonight.'"""
175,5,69,"Christine carried her hand to her heart, a prey to indescribable
emotion.  Her eyes stared before her like a madwoman's. Raoul was
terror - stricken. But suddenly Christine's eyes moistened and two great
tears trickled, like two pearls, down her ivory cheeks."
175,5,70,"""Christine!"""
175,5,71,"""Raoul!"""
175,5,72,"The young man tried to take her in his arms, but she escaped and fled
in great disorder."
175,5,73,"While Christine remained locked in her room, Raoul was at his wit's end
what to do.  He refused to breakfast.  He was terribly concerned and
bitterly grieved to see the hours, which he had hoped to find so sweet,
slip past without the presence of the young Swedish girl.  Why did she
not come to roam with him through the country where they had so many
memories in common?  He heard that she had had a mass said, that
morning, for the repose of her father's soul and spent a long time
praying in the little church and on the fiddler's tomb.  Then, as she
seemed to have nothing more to do at Perros and, in fact, was doing
nothing there, why did she not go back to Paris at once?"
175,5,74,"Raoul walked away, dejectedly, to the graveyard in which the church
stood and was indeed alone among the tombs, reading the inscriptions;
but, when he turned behind the apse, he was suddenly struck by the
dazzling note of the flowers that straggled over the white ground.
They were marvelous red roses that had blossomed in the morning, in the
snow, giving a glimpse of life among the dead, for death was all around
him.  It also, like the flowers, issued from the ground, which had
flung back a number of its corpses.  Skeletons and skulls by the
hundred were heaped against the wall of the church, held in position by
a wire that left the whole gruesome stack visible.  Dead men's bones,
arranged in rows, like bricks, to form the first course upon which the
walls of the sacristy had been built.  The door of the sacristy opened
in the middle of that bony structure, as is often seen in old Breton
churches."
175,5,75,"Raoul said a prayer for Daae and then, painfully impressed by all those
eternal smiles on the mouths of skulls, he climbed the slope and sat
down on the edge of the heath overlooking the sea.  The wind fell with
the evening.  Raoul was surrounded by icy darkness, but he did not feel
the cold.  It was here, he remembered, that he used to come with little
Christine to see the Korrigans dance at the rising of the moon.  He had
never seen any, though his eyes were good, whereas Christine, who was a
little shortsighted, pretended that she had seen many.  He smiled at
the thought and then suddenly gave a start.  A voice behind him said:"
175,5,76,"""Do you think the Korrigans will come this evening?"""
175,5,77,"It was Christine.  He tried to speak.  She put her gloved hand on his
mouth."
175,5,78,"""Listen, Raoul.  I have decided to tell you something serious, very
serious ... Do you remember the legend of the Angel of Music?"""
175,5,79,"""I do indeed,"" he said.  ""I believe it was here that your father first
told it to us."""
175,5,80,"""And it was here that he said, 'When I am in Heaven, my child, I will
send him to you.'  Well, Raoul, my father is in Heaven, and I have been
visited by the Angel of Music."""
175,5,81,"""I have no doubt of it,"" replied the young man gravely, for it seemed
to him that his friend, in obedience to a pious thought, was connecting
the memory of her father with the brilliancy of her last triumph."
175,5,82,Christine appeared astonished at the Vicomte de Chagny's coolness:
175,5,83,"""How do you understand it?"" she asked, bringing her pale face so close
to his that he might have thought that Christine was going to give him
a kiss; but she only wanted to read his eyes in spite of the dark."
175,5,84,"""I understand,"" he said, ""that no human being can sing as you sang the
other evening without the intervention of some miracle.  No professor
on earth can teach you such accents as those.  You have heard the Angel
of Music, Christine."""
175,5,85,"""Yes,"" she said solemnly, ""IN MY DRESSING - ROOM. That is where he comes
to give me my lessons daily."""
175,5,86,"""In your dressing - room?"" he echoed stupidly."
175,5,87,"""Yes, that is where I have heard him; and I have not been the only one
to hear him."""
175,5,88,"""Who else heard him, Christine?"""
175,5,89,"""You, my friend."""
175,5,90,"""I?  I heard the Angel of Music?"""
175,5,91,"""Yes, the other evening, it was he who was talking when you were
listening behind the door.  It was he who said, 'You must love me.' But
I then thought that I was the only one to hear his voice.  Imagine my
astonishment when you told me, this morning, that you could hear him
too."""
175,5,92,"Raoul burst out laughing.  The first rays of the moon came and shrouded
the two young people in their light.  Christine turned on Raoul with a
hostile air.  Her eyes, usually so gentle, flashed fire."
175,5,93,"""What are you laughing at?  YOU think you heard a man's voice, I
suppose?"""
175,5,94,"""Well! ..."" replied the young man, whose ideas began to grow confused
in the face of Christine's determined attitude."
175,5,95,"""It's you, Raoul, who say that?  You, an old playfellow of my own!  A
friend of my father's! But you have changed since those days.  What are
you thinking of?  I am an honest girl, M. le Vicomte de Chagny, and I
don't lock myself up in my dressing - room with men's voices.  If you had
opened the door, you would have seen that there was nobody in the room!"""
175,5,96,"""That's true!  I did open the door, when you were gone, and I found no
one in the room."""
175,5,97,"""So you see! ... Well?"""
175,5,98,The viscount summoned up all his courage.
175,5,99,"""Well, Christine, I think that somebody is making game of you."""
175,5,100,"She gave a cry and ran away.  He ran after her, but, in a tone of
fierce anger, she called out:  ""Leave me!  Leave me!"" And she
disappeared."
175,5,101,"Raoul returned to the inn feeling very weary, very low - spirited and
very sad.  He was told that Christine had gone to her bedroom saying
that she would not be down to dinner.  Raoul dined alone, in a very
gloomy mood.  Then he went to his room and tried to read, went to bed
and tried to sleep.  There was no sound in the next room."
175,5,102,"The hours passed slowly.  It was about half - past eleven when he
distinctly heard some one moving, with a light, stealthy step, in the
room next to his.  Then Christine had not gone to bed!  Without
troubling for a reason, Raoul dressed, taking care not to make a sound,
and waited.  Waited for what?  How could he tell?  But his heart
thumped in his chest when he heard Christine's door turn slowly on its
hinges.  Where could she be going, at this hour, when every one was
fast asleep at Perros?  Softly opening the door, he saw Christine's
white form, in the moonlight, slipping along the passage.  She went
down the stairs and he leaned over the baluster above her.  Suddenly he
heard two voices in rapid conversation.  He caught one sentence: ""Don't
lose the key."""
175,5,103,"It was the landlady's voice.  The door facing the sea was opened and
locked again.  Then all was still."
175,5,104,"Raoul ran back to his room and threw back the window.  Christine's
white form stood on the deserted quay."
175,5,105,"The first floor of the Setting Sun was at no great height and a tree
growing against the wall held out its branches to Raoul's impatient
arms and enabled him to climb down unknown to the landlady.  Her
amazement, therefore, was all the greater when, the next morning, the
young man was brought back to her half frozen, more dead than alive,
and when she learned that he had been found stretched at full length on
the steps of the high altar of the little church.  She ran at once to
tell Christine, who hurried down and, with the help of the landlady,
did her best to revive him.  He soon opened his eyes and was not long
in recovering when he saw his friend's charming face leaning over him."
175,5,106,"A few weeks later, when the tragedy at the Opera compelled the
intervention of the public prosecutor, M. Mifroid, the commissary of
police, examined the Vicomte de Chagny touching the events of the night
at Perros.  I quote the questions and answers as given in the official
report pp. 150 et seq.:"
175,5,107,"Q. ""Did Mlle. Daae not see you come down from your room by the curious
road which you selected?"""
175,5,108,"R. ""No, monsieur, no, although, when walking behind her, I took no
pains to deaden the sound of my footsteps.  In fact, I was anxious that
she should turn round and see me.  I realized that I had no excuse for
following her and that this way of spying on her was unworthy of me.
But she seemed not to hear me and acted exactly as though I were not
there.  She quietly left the quay and then suddenly walked quickly up
the road.  The church - clock had struck a quarter to twelve and I
thought that this must have made her hurry, for she began almost to run
and continued hastening until she came to the church."""
175,5,109,"Q. ""Was the gate open?"""
175,5,110,"R. ""Yes, monsieur, and this surprised me, but did not seem to surprise
Mlle. Daae."""
175,5,111,"Q. ""Was there no one in the churchyard?"""
175,5,112,"R. ""I did not see any one; and, if there had been, I must have seen
him.  The moon was shining on the snow and made the night quite light."""
175,5,113,"Q. ""Was it possible for any one to hide behind the tombstones?"""
175,5,114,"R. ""No, monsieur.  They were quite small, poor tombstones, partly
hidden under the snow, with their crosses just above the level of the
ground.  The only shadows were those of the crosses and ourselves.  The
church stood out quite brightly.  I never saw so clear a night.  It was
very fine and very cold and one could see everything."""
175,5,115,"Q. ""Are you at all superstitious?"""
175,5,116,"R. ""No, monsieur, I am a practising Catholic,"""
175,5,117,"Q. ""In what condition of mind were you?"""
175,5,118,"R. ""Very healthy and peaceful, I assure you.  Mlle. Daae's curious
action in going out at that hour had worried me at first; but, as soon
as I saw her go to the churchyard, I thought that she meant to fulfil
some pious duty on her father's grave and I considered this so natural
that I recovered all my calmness.  I was only surprised that she had
not heard me walking behind her, for my footsteps were quite audible on
the hard snow.  But she must have been taken up with her intentions and
I resolved not to disturb her.  She knelt down by her father's grave,
made the sign of the cross and began to pray.  At that moment, it
struck midnight.  At the last stroke, I saw Mlle. Daae life{sic} her
eyes to the sky and stretch out her arms as though in ecstasy.  I was
wondering what the reason could be, when I myself raised my head and
everything within me seemed drawn toward the invisible, WHICH WAS
PLAYING THE MOST PERFECT MUSIC!  Christine and I knew that music; we
had heard it as children.  But it had never been executed with such
divine art, even by M. Daae.  I remembered all that Christine had told
me of the Angel of Music.  The air was The Resurrection of Lazarus,
which old M. Daae used to play to us in his hours of melancholy and of
faith.  If Christine's Angel had existed, he could not have played
better, that night, on the late musician's violin.  When the music
stopped, I seemed to hear a noise from the skulls in the heap of bones;
it was as though they were chuckling and I could not help shuddering."""
175,5,119,"Q. ""Did it not occur to you that the musician might be hiding behind
that very heap of bones?"""
175,5,120,"R. ""It was the one thought that did occur to me, monsieur, so much so
that I omitted to follow Mlle. Daae, when she stood up and walked
slowly to the gate.  She was so much absorbed just then that I am not
surprised that she did not see me."""
175,5,121,"Q. ""Then what happened that you were found in the morning lying
half - dead on the steps of the high altar?"""
175,5,122,"R. ""First a skull rolled to my feet ... then another ... then another
... It was as if I were the mark of that ghastly game of bowls.  And I
had an idea that false step must have destroyed the balance of the
structure behind which our musician was concealed.  This surmise seemed
to be confirmed when I saw a shadow suddenly glide along the sacristy
wall.  I ran up.  The shadow had already pushed open the door and
entered the church.  But I was quicker than the shadow and caught hold
of a corner of its cloak.  At that moment, we were just in front of the
high altar; and the moonbeams fell straight upon us through the
stained - glass windows of the apse.  As I did not let go of the cloak,
the shadow turned round; and I saw a terrible death's head, which
darted a look at me from a pair of scorching eyes.  I felt as if I were
face to face with Satan; and, in the presence of this unearthly
apparition, my heart gave way, my courage failed me ... and I remember
nothing more until I recovered consciousness at the Setting Sun."""
175,6,1,"We left M. Firmin Richard and M. Armand Moncharmin at the moment when
they were deciding ""to look into that little matter of Box Five."""
175,6,2,"Leaving behind them the broad staircase which leads from the lobby
outside the managers' offices to the stage and its dependencies, they
crossed the stage, went out by the subscribers' door and entered the
house through the first little passage on the left.  Then they made
their way through the front rows of stalls and looked at Box Five on
the grand tier, They could not see it well, because it was half in
darkness and because great covers were flung over the red velvet of the
ledges of all the boxes."
175,6,3,"They were almost alone in the huge, gloomy house; and a great silence
surrounded them.  It was the time when most of the stage - hands go out
for a drink.  The staff had left the boards for the moment, leaving a
scene half set.  A few rays of light, a wan, sinister light, that
seemed to have been stolen from an expiring luminary, fell through some
opening or other upon an old tower that raised its pasteboard
battlements on the stage; everything, in this deceptive light, adopted
a fantastic shape.  In the orchestra stalls, the drugget covering them
looked like an angry sea, whose glaucous waves had been suddenly
rendered stationary by a secret order from the storm phantom, who, as
everybody knows, is called Adamastor.  MM. Moncharmin and Richard were
the shipwrecked mariners amid this motionless turmoil of a calico sea.
They made for the left boxes, plowing their way like sailors who leave
their ship and try to struggle to the shore.  The eight great polished
columns stood up in the dusk like so many huge piles supporting the
threatening, crumbling, big - bellied cliffs whose layers were
represented by the circular, parallel, waving lines of the balconies of
the grand, first and second tiers of boxes.  At the top, right on top
of the cliff, lost in M. Lenepveu's copper ceiling, figures grinned and
grimaced, laughed and jeered at MM. Richard and Moncharmin's distress.
And yet these figures were usually very serious.  Their names were
Isis, Amphitrite, Hebe, Pandora, Psyche, Thetis, Pomona, Daphne,
Clytie, Galatea and Arethusa.  Yes, Arethusa herself and Pandora, whom
we all know by her box, looked down upon the two new managers of the
Opera, who ended by clutching at some piece of wreckage and from there
stared silently at Box Five on the grand tier."
175,6,4,"I have said that they were distressed.  At least, I presume so.  M.
Moncharmin, in any case, admits that he was impressed.  To quote his
own words, in his Memoirs:"
175,6,5,"""This moonshine about the Opera ghost in which, since we first took
over the duties of MM. Poligny and Debienne, we had been so nicely
steeped"" -  - Moncharmin's style is not always irreproachable -  - ""had no
doubt ended by blinding my imaginative and also my visual faculties.
It may be that the exceptional surroundings in which we found
ourselves, in the midst of an incredible silence, impressed us to an
unusual extent.  It may be that we were the sport of a kind of
hallucination brought about by the semi - darkness of the theater and the
partial gloom that filled Box Five.  At any rate, I saw and Richard
also saw a shape in the box.  Richard said nothing, nor I either.  But
we spontaneously seized each other's hand.  We stood like that for some
minutes, without moving, with our eyes fixed on the same point; but the
figure had disappeared.  Then we went out and, in the lobby,
communicated our impressions to each other and talked about 'the
shape.'  The misfortune was that my shape was not in the least like
Richard's. I had seen a thing like a death's head resting on the ledge
of the box, whereas Richard saw the shape of an old woman who looked
like Mme. Giry.  We soon discovered that we had really been the victims
of an illusion, whereupon, without further delay and laughing like
madmen, we ran to Box Five on the grand tier, went inside and found no
shape of any kind."""
175,6,6,"Box Five is just like all the other grand tier boxes.  There is nothing
to distinguish it from any of the others.  M. Moncharmin and M.
Richard, ostensibly highly amused and laughing at each other, moved the
furniture of the box, lifted the cloths and the chairs and particularly
examined the arm - chair in which ""the man's voice"" used to sit.  But
they saw that it was a respectable arm - chair, with no magic about it.
Altogether, the box was the most ordinary box in the world, with its
red hangings, its chairs, its carpet and its ledge covered in red
velvet.  After, feeling the carpet in the most serious manner possible,
and discovering nothing more here or anywhere else, they went down to
the corresponding box on the pit tier below.  In Box Five on the pit
tier, which is just inside the first exit from the stalls on the left,
they found nothing worth mentioning either."
175,6,7,"""Those people are all making fools of us!""  Firmin Richard ended by
exclaiming.  ""It will be FAUST on Saturday:  let us both see the
performance from Box Five on the grand tier!"""
175,7,1,"On the Saturday morning, on reaching their office, the joint managers
found a letter from O. G. worded in these terms:"
175,7,2,MY DEAR MANAGERS:
175,7,3,So it is to be war between us?
175,7,4,"If you still care for peace, here is my ultimatum.  It consists of the
four following conditions:"
175,7,5,"1.  You must give me back my private box; and I wish it to be at my
free disposal from henceforward."
175,7,6,"2.  The part of Margarita shall be sung this evening by Christine Daae.
Never mind about Carlotta; she will be ill."
175,7,7,"3.  I absolutely insist upon the good and loyal services of Mme. Giry,
my box - keeper, whom you will reinstate in her functions forthwith."
175,7,8,"4.  Let me know by a letter handed to Mme. Giry, who will see that it
reaches me, that you accept, as your predecessors did, the conditions
in my memorandum - book relating to my monthly allowance.  I will inform
you later how you are to pay it to me."
175,7,9,"If you refuse, you will give FAUST to - night in a house with a curse
upon it."
175,7,10,Take my advice and be warned in time.  O. G.
175,7,11,"""Look here, I'm getting sick of him, sick of him!"" shouted Richard,
bringing his fists down on his office - table."
175,7,12,"Just then, Mercier, the acting - manager, entered."
175,7,13,"""Lachenel would like to see one of you gentlemen,"" he said.  ""He says
that his business is urgent and he seems quite upset."""
175,7,14,"""Who's Lachenel?"" asked Richard."
175,7,15,"""He's your stud - groom."""
175,7,16,"""What do you mean?  My stud - groom?"""
175,7,17,"""Yes, sir,"" explained Mercier, ""there are several grooms at the Opera
and M. Lachenel is at the head of them."""
175,7,18,"""And what does this groom do?"""
175,7,19,"""He has the chief management of the stable."""
175,7,20,"""What stable?"""
175,7,21,"""Why, yours, sir, the stable of the Opera."""
175,7,22,"""Is there a stable at the Opera?  Upon my word, I didn't know.  Where
is it?"""
175,7,23,"""In the cellars, on the Rotunda side.  It's a very important
department; we have twelve horses."""
175,7,24,"""Twelve horses!  And what for, in Heaven's name?"""
175,7,25,"""Why, we want trained horses for the processions in the Juive, The
Profeta and so on; horses 'used to the boards.'  It is the grooms'
business to teach them.  M. Lachenel is very clever at it.  He used to
manage Franconi's stables."""
175,7,26,"""Very well ... but what does he want?"""
175,7,27,"""I don't know; I never saw him in such a state."""
175,7,28,"""He can come in."""
175,7,29,"M. Lachenel came in, carrying a riding - whip, with which he struck his
right boot in an irritable manner."
175,7,30,"""Good morning, M. Lachenel,"" said Richard, somewhat impressed.  ""To
what do we owe the honor of your visit?"""
175,7,31,"""Mr. Manager, I have come to ask you to get rid of the whole stable."""
175,7,32,"""What, you want to get rid of our horses?"""
175,7,33,"""I'm not talking of the horses, but of the stablemen."""
175,7,34,"""How many stablemen have you, M. Lachenel?"""
175,7,35,"""Six stablemen!  That's at least two too many."""
175,7,36,"""These are 'places,'"" Mercier interposed, ""created and forced upon us
by the under - secretary for fine arts.  They are filled by protegees of
the government and, if I may venture to ..."""
175,7,37,"""I don't care a hang for the government!"" roared Richard.  ""We don't
need more than four stablemen for twelve horses."""
175,7,38,"""Eleven,"" said the head riding - master, correcting him."
175,7,39,"""Twelve,"" repeated Richard."
175,7,40,"""Eleven,"" repeated Lachenel."
175,7,41,"""Oh, the acting - manager told me that you had twelve horses!"""
175,7,42,"""I did have twelve, but I have only eleven since Cesar was stolen."""
175,7,43,And M. Lachenel gave himself a great smack on the boot with his whip.
175,7,44,"""Has Cesar been stolen?"" cried the acting - manager. ""Cesar, the white
horse in the Profeta?"""
175,7,45,"""There are not two Cesars,"" said the stud - groom dryly.  ""I was ten
years at Franconi's and I have seen plenty of horses in my time.  Well,
there are not two Cesars.  And he's been stolen."""
175,7,46,"""How?"""
175,7,47,"""I don't know.  Nobody knows.  That's why I have come to ask you to
sack the whole stable."""
175,7,48,"""What do your stablemen say?"""
175,7,49,"""All sorts of nonsense.  Some of them accuse the supers.  Others
pretend that it's the acting - manager's doorkeeper ..."""
175,7,50,"""My doorkeeper?  I'll answer for him as I would for myself!"" protested
Mercier."
175,7,51,"""But, after all, M. Lachenel,"" cried Richard, ""you must have some idea."""
175,7,52,"""Yes, I have,"" M. Lachenel declared.  ""I have an idea and I'll tell you
what it is.  There's no doubt about it in my mind."" He walked up to the
two managers and whispered.  ""It's the ghost who did the trick!"""
175,7,53,Richard gave a jump.
175,7,54,"""What, you too!  You too!"""
175,7,55,"""How do you mean, I too?  Isn't it natural, after what I saw?"""
175,7,56,"""What did you see?"""
175,7,57,"""I saw, as clearly as I now see you, a black shadow riding a white
horse that was as like Cesar as two peas!"""
175,7,58,"""And did you run after them?"""
175,7,59,"""I did and I shouted, but they were too fast for me and disappeared in
the darkness of the underground gallery."""
175,7,60,"M. Richard rose.  ""That will do, M. Lachenel.  You can go ...  We will
lodge a complaint against THE GHOST."""
175,7,61,"""And sack my stable?"""
175,7,62,"""Oh, of course!  Good morning."""
175,7,63,M. Lachenel bowed and withdrew.  Richard foamed at the mouth.
175,7,64,"""Settle that idiot's account at once, please."""
175,7,65,"""He is a friend of the government representative's!"" Mercier ventured
to say."
175,7,66,"""And he takes his vermouth at Tortoni's with Lagrene, Scholl and
Pertuiset, the lion - hunter,"" added Moncharmin.  ""We shall have the
whole press against us!  He'll tell the story of the ghost; and
everybody will be laughing at our expense!  We may as well be dead as
ridiculous!"""
175,7,67,"""All right, say no more about it."""
175,7,68,"At that moment the door opened.  It must have been deserted by its
usual Cerberus, for Mme. Giry entered without ceremony, holding a
letter in her hand, and said hurriedly:"
175,7,69,"""I beg your pardon, excuse me, gentlemen, but I had a letter this
morning from the Opera ghost.  He told me to come to you, that you had
something to ..."""
175,7,70,"She did not complete the sentence.  She saw Firmin Richard's face; and
it was a terrible sight.  He seemed ready to burst.  He said nothing,
he could not speak.  But suddenly he acted.  First, his left arm seized
upon the quaint person of Mme. Giry and made her describe so unexpected
a semicircle that she uttered a despairing cry.  Next, his right foot
imprinted its sole on the black taffeta of a skirt which certainly had
never before undergone a similar outrage in a similar place.  The thing
happened so quickly that Mme. Giry, when in the passage, was still
quite bewildered and seemed not to understand.  But, suddenly, she
understood; and the Opera rang with her indignant yells, her violent
protests and threats."
175,7,71,"About the same time, Carlotta, who had a small house of her own in the
Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, rang for her maid, who brought her letters
to her bed.  Among them was an anonymous missive, written in red ink,
in a hesitating, clumsy hand, which ran:"
175,7,72,"If you appear to - night, you must be prepared for a great misfortune at
the moment when you open your mouth to sing ... a misfortune worse than
death."
175,7,73,"The letter took away Carlotta's appetite for breakfast.  She pushed
back her chocolate, sat up in bed and thought hard.  It was not the
first letter of the kind which she had received, but she never had one
couched in such threatening terms."
175,7,74,"She thought herself, at that time, the victim of a thousand jealous
attempts and went about saying that she had a secret enemy who had
sworn to ruin her.  She pretended that a wicked plot was being hatched
against her, a cabal which would come to a head one of those days; but
she added that she was not the woman to be intimidated."
175,7,75,"The truth is that, if there was a cabal, it was led by Carlotta herself
against poor Christine, who had no suspicion of it.  Carlotta had never
forgiven Christine for the triumph which she had achieved when taking
her place at a moment's notice.  When Carlotta heard of the astounding
reception bestowed upon her understudy, she was at once cured of an
incipient attack of bronchitis and a bad fit of sulking against the
management and lost the slightest inclination to shirk her duties.
From that time, she worked with all her might to ""smother"" her rival,
enlisting the services of influential friends to persuade the managers
not to give Christine an opportunity for a fresh triumph.  Certain
newspapers which had begun to extol the talent of Christine now
interested themselves only in the fame of Carlotta.  Lastly, in the
theater itself, the celebrated, but heartless and soulless diva made
the most scandalous remarks about Christine and tried to cause her
endless minor unpleasantnesses."
175,7,76,"When Carlotta had finished thinking over the threat contained in the
strange letter, she got up."
175,7,77,"""We shall see,"" she said, adding a few oaths in her native Spanish with
a very determined air."
175,7,78,"The first thing she saw, when looking out of her window, was a hearse.
She was very superstitious; and the hearse and the letter convinced her
that she was running the most serious dangers that evening.  She
collected all her supporters, told them that she was threatened at that
evening's performance with a plot organized by Christine Daae and
declared that they must play a trick upon that chit by filling the
house with her, Carlotta's, admirers.  She had no lack of them, had
she?  She relied upon them to hold themselves prepared for any
eventuality and to silence the adversaries, if, as she feared, they
created a disturbance."
175,7,79,"M. Richard's private secretary called to ask after the diva's health
and returned with the assurance that she was perfectly well and that,
""were she dying,"" she would sing the part of Margarita that evening.
The secretary urged her, in his chief's name, to commit no imprudence,
to stay at home all day and to be careful of drafts; and Carlotta could
not help, after he had gone, comparing this unusual and unexpected
advice with the threats contained in the letter."
175,7,80,"It was five o'clock when the post brought a second anonymous letter in
the same hand as the first.  It was short and said simply:"
175,7,81,"You have a bad cold.  If you are wise, you will see that it is madness
to try to sing to - night."
175,7,82,"Carlotta sneered, shrugged her handsome shoulders and sang two or three
notes to reassure herself."
175,7,83,"Her friends were faithful to their promise.  They were all at the Opera
that night, but looked round in vain for the fierce conspirators whom
they were instructed to suppress.  The only unusual thing was the
presence of M. Richard and M. Moncharmin in Box Five.  Carlotta's
friends thought that, perhaps, the managers had wind, on their side, of
the proposed disturbance and that they had determined to be in the
house, so as to stop it then and there; but this was unjustifiable
supposition, as the reader knows.  M. Richard and M. Moncharmin were
thinking of nothing but their ghost."
175,7,84,"""Vain!  In vain do I call, through my vigil weary, On creation and its
Lord!  Never reply will break the silence dreary!  No sign!  No single
word!"""
175,7,85,"The famous baritone, Carolus Fonta, had hardly finished Doctor Faust's
first appeal to the powers of darkness, when M. Firmin Richard, who was
sitting in the ghost's own chair, the front chair on the right, leaned
over to his partner and asked him chaffingly:"
175,7,86,"""Well, has the ghost whispered a word in your ear yet?"""
175,7,87,"""Wait, don't be in such a hurry,"" replied M. Armand Moncharmin, in the
same gay tone.  ""The performance has only begun and you know that the
ghost does not usually come until the middle of the first act."""
175,7,88,"The first act passed without incident, which did not surprise
Carlotta's friends, because Margarita does not sing in this act.  As
for the managers, they looked at each other, when the curtain fell."
175,7,89,"""That's one!"" said Moncharmin."
175,7,90,"""Yes, the ghost is late,"" said Firmin Richard."
175,7,91,"""It's not a bad house,"" said Moncharmin, ""for 'a house with a curse on
it.'"""
175,7,92,"M. Richard smiled and pointed to a fat, rather vulgar woman, dressed in
black, sitting in a stall in the middle of the auditorium with a man in
a broadcloth frock - coat on either side of her."
175,7,93,"""Who on earth are 'those?'"" asked Moncharmin."
175,7,94,"""'Those,' my dear fellow, are my concierge, her husband and her
brother."""
175,7,95,"""Did you give them their tickets?"""
175,7,96,"""I did ... My concierge had never been to the Opera -  - this is, the first
time -  - and, as she is now going to come every night, I wanted her to
have a good seat, before spending her time showing other people to
theirs."""
175,7,97,"Moncharmin asked what he meant and Richard answered that he had
persuaded his concierge, in whom he had the greatest confidence, to
come and take Mme. Giry's place.  Yes, he would like to see if, with
that woman instead of the old lunatic, Box Five would continue to
astonish the natives?"
175,7,98,"""By the way,"" said Moncharmin, ""you know that Mother Giry is going to
lodge a complaint against you."""
175,7,99,"""With whom?  The ghost?"""
175,7,100,"The ghost!  Moncharmin had almost forgotten him.  However, that
mysterious person did nothing to bring himself to the memory of the
managers; and they were just saying so to each other for the second
time, when the door of the box suddenly opened to admit the startled
stage - manager."
175,7,101,"""What's the matter?"" they both asked, amazed at seeing him there at
such a time."
175,7,102,"""It seems there's a plot got up by Christine Daae's friends against
Carlotta.  Carlotta's furious."""
175,7,103,"""What on earth ... ?"" said Richard, knitting his brows."
175,7,104,"But the curtain rose on the kermess scene and Richard made a sign to
the stage - manager to go away.  When the two were alone again,
Moncharmin leaned over to Richard:"
175,7,105,"""Then Daae has friends?"" he asked."
175,7,106,"""Yes, she has."""
175,7,107,"""Whom?"""
175,7,108,"Richard glanced across at a box on the grand tier containing no one but
two men."
175,7,109,"""The Comte de Chagny?"""
175,7,110,"""Yes, he spoke to me in her favor with such warmth that, if I had not
known him to be Sorelli's friend ..."""
175,7,111,"""Really?  Really?"" said Moncharmin.  ""And who is that pale young man
beside him?"""
175,7,112,"""That's his brother, the viscount."""
175,7,113,"""He ought to be in his bed.  He looks ill."""
175,7,114,The stage rang with gay song:
175,7,115,"""Red or white liquor,
Coarse or fine!
What can it matter,
So we have wine?"""
175,7,116,"Students, citizens, soldiers, girls and matrons whirled light - heartedly
before the inn with the figure of Bacchus for a sign.  Siebel made her
entrance.  Christine Daae looked charming in her boy's clothes; and
Carlotta's partisans expected to hear her greeted with an ovation which
would have enlightened them as to the intentions of her friends.  But
nothing happened."
175,7,117,"On the other hand, when Margarita crossed the stage and sang the only
two lines allotted her in this second act:"
175,7,118,"""No, my lord, not a lady am I, nor yet a beauty,
And do not need an arm to help me on my way,"""
175,7,119,"Carlotta was received with enthusiastic applause.  It was so unexpected
and so uncalled for that those who knew nothing about the rumors looked
at one another and asked what was happening.  And this act also was
finished without incident."
175,7,120,"Then everybody said:  ""Of course, it will be during the next act."""
175,7,121,"Some, who seemed to be better informed than the rest, declared that the
""row"" would begin with the ballad of the KING OF THULE and rushed to
the subscribers' entrance to warn Carlotta.  The managers left the box
during the entr'acte to find out more about the cabal of which the
stage - manager had spoken; but they soon returned to their seats,
shrugging their shoulders and treating the whole affair as silly."
175,7,122,"The first thing they saw, on entering the box, was a box of English
sweets on the little shelf of the ledge.  Who had put it there?  They
asked the box - keepers, but none of them knew.  Then they went back to
the shelf and, next to the box of sweets, found an opera glass.  They
looked at each other.  They had no inclination to laugh.  All that Mme.
Giry had told them returned to their memory ... and then ... and then
... they seemed to feel a curious sort of draft around them ... They
sat down in silence."
175,7,123,The scene represented Margarita's garden:
175,7,124,"""Gentle flow'rs in the dew,
Be message from me ..."""
175,7,125,"As she sang these first two lines, with her bunch of roses and lilacs
in her hand, Christine, raising her head, saw the Vicomte de Chagny in
his box; and, from that moment, her voice seemed less sure, less
crystal - clear than usual.  Something seemed to deaden and dull her
singing..."
175,7,126,"""What a queer girl she is!"" said one of Carlotta's friends in the
stalls, almost aloud.  ""The other day she was divine; and to - night
she's simply bleating.  She has no experience, no training."""
175,7,127,"""Gentle flow'rs, lie ye there
And tell her from me ..."""
175,7,128,"The viscount put his head under his hands and wept.  The count, behind
him, viciously gnawed his mustache, shrugged his shoulders and frowned.
For him, usually so cold and correct, to betray his inner feelings like
that, by outward signs, the count must be very angry.  He was.  He had
seen his brother return from a rapid and mysterious journey in an
alarming state of health.  The explanation that followed was
unsatisfactory and the count asked Christine Daae for an appointment.
She had the audacity to reply that she could not see either him or his
brother..."
175,7,129,"""Would she but deign to hear me
And with one smile to cheer me ..."""
175,7,130,"""The little baggage!"" growled the count."
175,7,131,"And he wondered what she wanted.  What she was hoping for... She was a
virtuous girl, she was said to have no friend, no protector of any sort
...  That angel from the North must be very artful!"
175,7,132,"Raoul, behind the curtain of his hands that veiled his boyish tears,
thought only of the letter which he received on his return to Paris,
where Christine, fleeing from Perros like a thief in the night, had
arrived before him:"
175,7,133,MY DEAR LITTLE PLAYFELLOW:
175,7,134,"You must have the courage not to see me again, not to speak of me
again.  If you love me just a little, do this for me, for me who will
never forget you, my dear Raoul.  My life depends upon it.  Your life
depends upon it.  YOUR LITTLE CHRISTINE."
175,7,135,Thunders of applause.  Carlotta made her entrance.
175,7,136,"""I wish I could but know who was he
That addressed me,
If he was noble, or, at least, what his name is ..."""
175,7,137,"When Margarita had finished singing the ballad of the KING OF THULE,
she was loudly cheered and again when she came to the end of the jewel
song:"
175,7,138,"""Ah, the joy of past compare
These jewels bright to wear! ..."""
175,7,139,"Thenceforth, certain of herself, certain of her friends in the house,
certain of her voice and her success, fearing nothing, Carlotta flung
herself into her part without restraint of modesty ...  She was no
longer Margarita, she was Carmen.  She was applauded all the more; and
her debut with Faust seemed about to bring her a new success, when
suddenly ... a terrible thing happened."
175,7,140,Faust had knelt on one knee:
175,7,141,"""Let me gaze on the form below me,
While from yonder ether blue
Look how the star of eve, bright and tender,
lingers o'er me,
To love thy beauty too!"""
175,7,142,And Margarita replied:
175,7,143,"""Oh, how strange!
Like a spell does the evening bind me!
And a deep languid charm
I feel without alarm
With its melody enwind me
And all my heart subdue."""
175,7,144,"At that moment, at that identical moment, the terrible thing
happened... Carlotta croaked like a toad:"
175,7,145,"""Co - ack!"""
175,7,146,"There was consternation on Carlotta's face and consternation on the
faces of all the audience.  The two managers in their box could not
suppress an exclamation of horror.  Every one felt that the thing was
not natural, that there was witchcraft behind it.  That toad smelt of
brimstone.  Poor, wretched, despairing, crushed Carlotta!"
175,7,147,"The uproar in the house was indescribable.  If the thing had happened
to any one but Carlotta, she would have been hooted.  But everybody
knew how perfect an instrument her voice was; and there was no display
of anger, but only of horror and dismay, the sort of dismay which men
would have felt if they had witnessed the catastrophe that broke the
arms of the Venus de Milo...  And even then they would have seen ...
and understood ..."
175,7,148,"But here that toad was incomprehensible!  So much so that, after some
seconds spent in asking herself if she had really heard that note, that
sound, that infernal noise issue from her throat, she tried to persuade
herself that it was not so, that she was the victim of an illusion, an
illusion of the ear, and not of an act of treachery on the part of her
voice...."
175,7,149,"Meanwhile, in Box Five, Moncharmin and Richard had turned very pale.
This extraordinary and inexplicable incident filled them with a dread
which was the more mysterious inasmuch as for some little while, they
had fallen within the direct influence of the ghost.  They had felt his
breath.  Moncharmin's hair stood on end.  Richard wiped the
perspiration from his forehead.  Yes, the ghost was there, around them,
behind them, beside them; they felt his presence without seeing him,
they heard his breath, close, close, close to them! ... They were sure
that there were three people in the box ...  They trembled ...  They
thought of running away ...  They dared not ...  They dared not make a
movement or exchange a word that would have told the ghost that they
knew that he was there! ... What was going to happen?"
175,7,150,This happened.
175,7,151,"""Co - ack!"" Their joint exclamation of horror was heard all over the
house.  THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE SMARTING UNDER THE GHOST'S ATTACKS.
Leaning over the ledge of their box, they stared at Carlotta as though
they did not recognize her.  That infernal girl must have given the
signal for some catastrophe.  Ah, they were waiting for the
catastrophe!  The ghost had told them it would come!  The house had a
curse upon it!  The two managers gasped and panted under the weight of
the catastrophe.  Richard's stifled voice was heard calling to Carlotta:"
175,7,152,"""Well, go on!"""
175,7,153,"No, Carlotta did not go on ...  Bravely, heroically, she started afresh
on the fatal line at the end of which the toad had appeared."
175,7,154,"An awful silence succeeded the uproar.  Carlotta's voice alone once
more filled the resounding house:"
175,7,155,"""I feel without alarm ..."""
175,7,156,"The audience also felt, but not without alarm. .."
175,7,157,"""I feel without alarm ...
I feel without alarm -  - co - ack!
With its melody enwind me -  - co - ack!
And all my heart sub -  - co - ack!"""
175,7,158,The toad also had started afresh!
175,7,159,"The house broke into a wild tumult.  The two managers collapsed in
their chairs and dared not even turn round; they had not the strength;
the ghost was chuckling behind their backs!  And, at last, they
distinctly heard his voice in their right ears, the impossible voice,
the mouthless voice, saying:"
175,7,160,"""SHE IS SINGING TO - NIGHT TO BRING THE CHANDELIER DOWN!"""
175,7,161,"With one accord, they raised their eyes to the ceiling and uttered a
terrible cry.  The chandelier, the immense mass of the chandelier was
slipping down, coming toward them, at the call of that fiendish voice.
Released from its hook, it plunged from the ceiling and came smashing
into the middle of the stalls, amid a thousand shouts of terror.  A
wild rush for the doors followed."
175,7,162,"The papers of the day state that there were numbers wounded and one
killed.  The chandelier had crashed down upon the head of the wretched
woman who had come to the Opera for the first time in her life, the one
whom M. Richard had appointed to succeed Mme. Giry, the ghost's
box - keeper, in her functions!  She died on the spot and, the next
morning, a newspaper appeared with this heading:"
175,7,163,TWO HUNDRED KILOS ON THE HEAD OF A CONCIERGE
175,7,164,That was her sole epitaph!
175,8,1,"That tragic evening was bad for everybody.  Carlotta fell ill.  As for
Christine Daae, she disappeared after the performance.  A fortnight
elapsed during which she was seen neither at the Opera nor outside."
175,8,2,"Raoul, of course, was the first to be astonished at the prima donna's
absence.  He wrote to her at Mme. Valerius' flat and received no reply.
His grief increased and he ended by being seriously alarmed at never
seeing her name on the program.  FAUST was played without her."
175,8,3,"One afternoon he went to the managers' office to ask the reason of
Christine's disappearance.  He found them both looking extremely
worried.  Their own friends did not recognize them: they had lost all
their gaiety and spirits.  They were seen crossing the stage with
hanging heads, care - worn brows, pale cheeks, as though pursued by some
abominable thought or a prey to some persistent sport of fate."
175,8,4,"The fall of the chandelier had involved them in no little
responsibility; but it was difficult to make them speak about it.  The
inquest had ended in a verdict of accidental death, caused by the wear
and tear of the chains by which the chandelier was hung from the
ceiling; but it was the duty of both the old and the new managers to
have discovered this wear and tear and to have remedied it in time.
And I feel bound to say that MM. Richard and Moncharmin at this time
appeared so changed, so absent - minded, so mysterious, so
incomprehensible that many of the subscribers thought that some event
even more horrible than the fall of the chandelier must have affected
their state of mind."
175,8,5,"In their daily intercourse, they showed themselves very impatient,
except with Mme. Giry, who had been reinstated in her functions.  And
their reception of the Vicomte de Chagny, when he came to ask about
Christine, was anything but cordial.  They merely told him that she was
taking a holiday.  He asked how long the holiday was for, and they
replied curtly that it was for an unlimited period, as Mlle. Daae had
requested leave of absence for reasons of health."
175,8,6,"""Then she is ill!"" he cried.  ""What is the matter with her?"""
175,8,7,"""We don't know."""
175,8,8,"""Didn't you send the doctor of the Opera to see her?"""
175,8,9,"""No, she did not ask for him; and, as we trust her, we took her word."""
175,8,10,"Raoul left the building a prey to the gloomiest thoughts.  He resolved,
come what might, to go and inquire of Mamma Valerius.  He remembered
the strong phrases in Christine's letter, forbidding him to make any
attempt to see her.  But what he had seen at Perros, what he had heard
behind the dressing - room door, his conversation with Christine at the
edge of the moor made him suspect some machination which, devilish
though it might be, was none the less human.  The girl's highly strung
imagination, her affectionate and credulous mind, the primitive
education which had surrounded her childhood with a circle of legends,
the constant brooding over her dead father and, above all, the state of
sublime ecstasy into which music threw her from the moment that this
art was made manifest to her in certain exceptional conditions, as in
the churchyard at Perros; all this seemed to him to constitute a moral
ground only too favorable for the malevolent designs of some mysterious
and unscrupulous person.  Of whom was Christine Daae the victim?  This
was the very reasonable question which Raoul put to himself as he
hurried off to Mamma Valerius."
175,8,11,"He trembled as he rang at a little flat in the Rue
Notre - Dame - des - Victoires.  The door was opened by the maid whom he had
seen coming out of Christine's dressing - room one evening.  He asked if
he could speak to Mme. Valerius.  He was told that she was ill in bed
and was not receiving visitors."
175,8,12,"""Take in my card, please,"" he said."
175,8,13,"The maid soon returned and showed him into a small and scantily
furnished drawing - room, in which portraits of Professor Valerius and
old Daae hung on opposite walls."
175,8,14,"""Madame begs Monsieur le Vicomte to excuse her,"" said the servant.
""She can only see him in her bedroom, because she can no longer stand
on her poor legs."""
175,8,15,"Five minutes later, Raoul was ushered into an ill - lit room where he at
once recognized the good, kind face of Christine's benefactress in the
semi - darkness of an alcove.  Mamma Valerius' hair was now quite white,
but her eyes had grown no older; never, on the contrary, had their
expression been so bright, so pure, so child - like."
175,8,16,"""M. de Chagny!"" she cried gaily, putting out both her hands to her
visitor.  ""Ah, it's Heaven that sends you here! ... We can talk of HER."""
175,8,17,"This last sentence sounded very gloomily in the young man's ears.  He
at once asked:"
175,8,18,"""Madame ... where is Christine?"""
175,8,19,And the old lady replied calmly:
175,8,20,"""She is with her good genius!"""
175,8,21,"""What good genius?"" exclaimed poor Raoul."
175,8,22,"""Why, the Angel of Music!"""
175,8,23,"The viscount dropped into a chair.  Really?  Christine was with the
Angel of Music?  And there lay Mamma Valerius in bed, smiling to him
and putting her finger to her lips, to warn him to be silent!  And she
added:"
175,8,24,"""You must not tell anybody!"""
175,8,25,"""You can rely on me,"" said Raoul."
175,8,26,"He hardly knew what he was saying, for his ideas about Christine,
already greatly confused, were becoming more and more entangled; and it
seemed as if everything was beginning to turn around him, around the
room, around that extraordinary good lady with the white hair and
forget - me - not eyes."
175,8,27,"""I know!  I know I can!"" she said, with a happy laugh.  ""But why don't
you come near me, as you used to do when you were a little boy?  Give
me your hands, as when you brought me the story of little Lotte, which
Daddy Daae had told you.  I am very fond of you, M. Raoul, you know.
And so is Christine too!"""
175,8,28,"""She is fond of me!"" sighed the young man.  He found a difficulty in
collecting his thoughts and bringing them to bear on Mamma Valerius'
""good genius,"" on the Angel of Music of whom Christine had spoken to
him so strangely, on the death's head which he had seen in a sort of
nightmare on the high altar at Perros and also on the Opera ghost,
whose fame had come to his ears one evening when he was standing behind
the scenes, within hearing of a group of scene - shifters who were
repeating the ghastly description which the hanged man, Joseph Buquet,
had given of the ghost before his mysterious death."
175,8,29,"He asked in a low voice:  ""What makes you think that Christine is fond
of me, madame?"""
175,8,30,"""She used to speak of you every day."""
175,8,31,"""Really? ... And what did she tell you?"""
175,8,32,"""She told me that you had made her a proposal!"""
175,8,33,"And the good old lady began laughing wholeheartedly.  Raoul sprang from
his chair, flushing to the temples, suffering agonies."
175,8,34,"""What's this?  Where are you going?  Sit down again at once, will you?
... Do you think I will let you go like that? ... If you're angry with
me for laughing, I beg your pardon... After all, what has happened
isn't your fault... Didn't you know? ... Did you think that Christine
was free? ..."""
175,8,35,"""Is Christine engaged to be married?"" the wretched Raoul asked, in a
choking voice."
175,8,36,"""Why no!  Why no! ... You know as well as I do that Christine couldn't
marry, even if she wanted to!"""
175,8,37,"""But I don't know anything about it! ... And why can't Christine marry?"""
175,8,38,"""Because of the Angel of Music, of course! ..."""
175,8,39,"""I don't follow ..."""
175,8,40,"""Yes, he forbids her to! ..."""
175,8,41,"""He forbids her! ... The Angel of Music forbids her to marry!"""
175,8,42,"""Oh, he forbids her ... without forbidding her.  It's like this: he
tells her that, if she got married, she would never hear him again.
That's all! ... And that he would go away for ever! ... So, you
understand, she can't let the Angel of Music go.  It's quite natural."""
175,8,43,"""Yes, yes,"" echoed Raoul submissively, ""it's quite natural."""
175,8,44,"""Besides, I thought Christine had told you all that, when she met you
at Perros, where she went with her good genius."""
175,8,45,"""Oh, she went to Perros with her good genius, did she?"""
175,8,46,"""That is to say, he arranged to meet her down there, in Perros
churchyard, at Daae's grave.  He promised to play her The Resurrection
of Lazarus on her father's violin!"""
175,8,47,"Raoul de Chagny rose and, with a very authoritative air, pronounced
these peremptory words:"
175,8,48,"""Madame, you will have the goodness to tell me where that genius lives."""
175,8,49,"The old lady did not seem surprised at this indiscreet command.  She
raised her eyes and said:"
175,8,50,"""In Heaven!"""
175,8,51,"Such simplicity baffled him.  He did not know what to say in the
presence of this candid and perfect faith in a genius who came down
nightly from Heaven to haunt the dressing - rooms at the Opera."
175,8,52,"He now realized the possible state of mind of a girl brought up between
a superstitious fiddler and a visionary old lady and he shuddered when
he thought of the consequences of it all."
175,8,53,"""Is Christine still a good girl?"" he asked suddenly, in spite of
himself."
175,8,54,"""I swear it, as I hope to be saved!"" exclaimed the old woman, who, this
time, seemed to be incensed.  ""And, if you doubt it, sir, I don't know
what you are here for!"""
175,8,55,Raoul tore at his gloves.
175,8,56,"""How long has she known this 'genius?'"""
175,8,57,"""About three months ...  Yes, it's quite three months since he began to
give her lessons."""
175,8,58,The viscount threw up his arms with a gesture of despair.
175,8,59,"""The genius gives her lessons! ... And where, pray?"""
175,8,60,"""Now that she has gone away with him, I can't say; but, up to a
fortnight ago, it was in Christine's dressing - room. It would be
impossible in this little flat.  The whole house would hear them.
Whereas, at the Opera, at eight o'clock in the morning, there is no one
about, do you see!"""
175,8,61,"""Yes, I see!  I see!"" cried the viscount."
175,8,62,"And he hurriedly took leave of Mme. Valerius, who asked herself if the
young nobleman was not a little off his head."
175,8,63,"He walked home to his brother's house in a pitiful state.  He could
have struck himself, banged his head against the walls!  To think that
he had believed in her innocence, in her purity!  The Angel of Music!
He knew him now!  He saw him!  It was beyond a doubt some unspeakable
tenor, a good - looking jackanapes, who mouthed and simpered as he sang!
He thought himself as absurd and as wretched as could be.  Oh, what a
miserable, little, insignificant, silly young man was M. le Vicomte de
Chagny! thought Raoul, furiously.  And she, what a bold and damnable
sly creature!"
175,8,64,"His brother was waiting for him and Raoul fell into his arms, like a
child.  The count consoled him, without asking for explanations; and
Raoul would certainly have long hesitated before telling him the story
of the Angel of Music.  His brother suggested taking him out to dinner.
Overcome as he was with despair, Raoul would probably have refused any
invitation that evening, if the count had not, as an inducement, told
him that the lady of his thoughts had been seen, the night before, in
company of the other sex in the Bois.  At first, the viscount refused
to believe; but he received such exact details that he ceased
protesting.  She had been seen, it appeared, driving in a brougham,
with the window down.  She seemed to be slowly taking in the icy night
air.  There was a glorious moon shining.  She was recognized beyond a
doubt.  As for her companion, only his shadowy outline was
distinguished leaning back in the dark.  The carriage was going at a
walking pace in a lonely drive behind the grand stand at Longchamp."
175,8,65,"Raoul dressed in frantic haste, prepared to forget his distress by
flinging himself, as people say, into ""the vortex of pleasure."" Alas,
he was a very sorry guest and, leaving his brother early, found
himself, by ten o'clock in the evening, in a cab, behind the Longchamp
race - course."
175,8,66,"It was bitterly cold.  The road seemed deserted and very bright under
the moonlight.  He told the driver to wait for him patiently at the
corner of a near turning and, hiding himself as well as he could, stood
stamping his feet to keep warm.  He had been indulging in this healthy
exercise for half an hour or so, when a carriage turned the corner of
the road and came quietly in his direction, at a walking pace."
175,8,67,"As it approached, he saw that a woman was leaning her head from the
window.  And, suddenly, the moon shed a pale gleam over her features."
175,8,68,"""Christine!"""
175,8,69,"The sacred name of his love had sprung from his heart and his lips.  He
could not keep it back... He would have given anything to withdraw it,
for that name, proclaimed in the stillness of the night, had acted as
though it were the preconcerted signal for a furious rush on the part
of the whole turn - out, which dashed past him before he could put into
execution his plan of leaping at the horses' heads.  The carriage
window had been closed and the girl's face had disappeared.  And the
brougham, behind which he was now running, was no more than a black
spot on the white road."
175,8,70,"He called out again:  ""Christine!"""
175,8,71,No reply.  And he stopped in the midst of the silence.
175,8,72,"With a lack - luster eye, he stared down that cold, desolate road and
into the pale, dead night.  Nothing was colder than his heart, nothing
half so dead:  he had loved an angel and now he despised a woman!"
175,8,73,"Raoul, how that little fairy of the North has trifled with you!  Was it
really, was it really necessary to have so fresh and young a face, a
forehead so shy and always ready to cover itself with the pink blush of
modesty in order to pass in the lonely night, in a carriage and pair,
accompanied by a mysterious lover?  Surely there should be some limit
to hypocrisy and lying! ..."
175,8,74,"She had passed without answering his cry ...  And he was thinking of
dying; and he was twenty years old! ..."
175,8,75,"His valet found him in the morning sitting on his bed.  He had not
undressed and the servant feared, at the sight of his face, that some
disaster had occurred.  Raoul snatched his letters from the man's
hands.  He had recognized Christine's paper and hand - writing. She said:"
175,8,76,DEAR:
175,8,77,"Go to the masked ball at the Opera on the night after to - morrow.  At
twelve o'clock, be in the little room behind the chimney - place of the
big crush - room. Stand near the door that leads to the Rotunda.  Don't
mention this appointment to any one on earth.  Wear a white domino and
be carefully masked.  As you love me, do not let yourself be
recognized.  CHRISTINE."
175,9,1,"The envelope was covered with mud and unstamped.  It bore the words ""To
be handed to M. le Vicomte Raoul de Chagny,"" with the address in
pencil.  It must have been flung out in the hope that a passer - by would
pick up the note and deliver it, which was what happened.  The note had
been picked up on the pavement of the Place de l'Opera."
175,9,2,"Raoul read it over again with fevered eyes.  No more was needed to
revive his hope.  The somber picture which he had for a moment imagined
of a Christine forgetting her duty to herself made way for his original
conception of an unfortunate, innocent child, the victim of imprudence
and exaggerated sensibility.  To what extent, at this time, was she
really a victim?  Whose prisoner was she?  Into what whirlpool had she
been dragged?  He asked himself these questions with a cruel anguish;
but even this pain seemed endurable beside the frenzy into which he was
thrown at the thought of a lying and deceitful Christine.  What had
happened?  What influence had she undergone?  What monster had carried
her off and by what means? ..."
175,9,3,"By what means indeed but that of music?  He knew Christine's story.
After her father's death, she acquired a distaste of everything in
life, including her art.  She went through the CONSERVATOIRE like a
poor soulless singing - machine.  And, suddenly, she awoke as though
through the intervention of a god.  The Angel of Music appeared upon
the scene!  She sang Margarita in FAUST and triumphed! ..."
175,9,4,"The Angel of Music! ... For three months the Angel of Music had been
giving Christine lessons ...  Ah, he was a punctual singing - master! ...
And now he was taking her for drives in the Bois! ..."
175,9,5,"Raoul's fingers clutched at his flesh, above his jealous heart.  In his
inexperience, he now asked himself with terror what game the girl was
playing?  Up to what point could an opera - singer make a fool of a
good - natured young man, quite new to love?  O misery! ..."
175,9,6,"Thus did Raoul's thoughts fly from one extreme to the other.  He no
longer knew whether to pity Christine or to curse her; and he pitied
and cursed her turn and turn about.  At all events, he bought a white
domino."
175,9,7,"The hour of the appointment came at last.  With his face in a mask
trimmed with long, thick lace, looking like a pierrot in his white
wrap, the viscount thought himself very ridiculous.  Men of the world
do not go to the Opera ball in fancy - dress! It was absurd.  One
thought, however, consoled the viscount:  he would certainly never be
recognized!"
175,9,8,"This ball was an exceptional affair, given some time before Shrovetide,
in honor of the anniversary of the birth of a famous draftsman; and it
was expected to be much gayer, noisier, more Bohemian than the ordinary
masked ball.  Numbers of artists had arranged to go, accompanied by a
whole cohort of models and pupils, who, by midnight, began to create a
tremendous din.  Raoul climbed the grand staircase at five minutes to
twelve, did not linger to look at the motley dresses displayed all the
way up the marble steps, one of the richest settings in the world,
allowed no facetious mask to draw him into a war of wits, replied to no
jests and shook off the bold familiarity of a number of couples who had
already become a trifle too gay.  Crossing the big crush - room and
escaping from a mad whirl of dancers in which he was caught for a
moment, he at last entered the room mentioned in Christine's letter.
He found it crammed; for this small space was the point where all those
who were going to supper in the Rotunda crossed those who were
returning from taking a glass of champagne.  The fun, here, waxed fast
and furious."
175,9,9,"Raoul leaned against a door - post and waited.  He did not wait long.  A
black domino passed and gave a quick squeeze to the tips of his
fingers.  He understood that it was she and followed her:"
175,9,10,"""Is that you, Christine?"" he asked, between his teeth."
175,9,11,"The black domino turned round promptly and raised her finger to her
lips, no doubt to warn him not to mention her name again.  Raoul
continued to follow her in silence."
175,9,12,"He was afraid of losing her, after meeting her again in such strange
circumstances.  His grudge against her was gone.  He no longer doubted
that she had ""nothing to reproach herself with,"" however peculiar and
inexplicable her conduct might seem.  He was ready to make any display
of clemency, forgiveness or cowardice.  He was in love.  And, no doubt,
he would soon receive a very natural explanation of her curious absence."
175,9,13,"The black domino turned back from time to time to see if the white
domino was still following."
175,9,14,"As Raoul once more passed through the great crush - room, this time in
the wake of his guide, he could not help noticing a group crowding
round a person whose disguise, eccentric air and gruesome appearance
were causing a sensation.  It was a man dressed all in scarlet, with a
huge hat and feathers on the top of a wonderful death's head.  From his
shoulders hung an immense red - velvet cloak, which trailed along the
floor like a king's train; and on this cloak was embroidered, in gold
letters, which every one read and repeated aloud, ""Don't touch me!  I
am Red Death stalking abroad!"""
175,9,15,"Then one, greatly daring, did try to touch him ... but a skeleton hand
shot out of a crimson sleeve and violently seized the rash one's wrist;
and he, feeling the clutch of the knucklebones, the furious grasp of
Death, uttered a cry of pain and terror.  When Red Death released him
at last, he ran away like a very madman, pursued by the jeers of the
bystanders."
175,9,16,"It was at this moment that Raoul passed in front of the funereal
masquerader, who had just happened to turn in his direction.  And he
nearly exclaimed:"
175,9,17,"""The death's head of Perros - Guirec!"""
175,9,18,"He had recognized him! ... He wanted to dart forward, forgetting
Christine; but the black domino, who also seemed a prey to some strange
excitement, caught him by the arm and dragged him from the crush - room,
far from the mad crowd through which Red Death was stalking..."
175,9,19,"The black domino kept on turning back and, apparently, on two occasions
saw something that startled her, for she hurried her pace and Raoul's
as though they were being pursued."
175,9,20,"They went up two floors.  Here, the stairs and corridors were almost
deserted.  The black domino opened the door of a private box and
beckoned to the white domino to follow her.  Then Christine, whom he
recognized by the sound of her voice, closed the door behind them and
warned him, in a whisper, to remain at the back of the box and on no
account to show himself.  Raoul took off his mask.  Christine kept hers
on.  And, when Raoul was about to ask her to remove it, he was
surprised to see her put her ear to the partition and listen eagerly
for a sound outside.  Then she opened the door ajar, looked out into
the corridor and, in a low voice, said:"
175,9,21,"""He must have gone up higher.""  Suddenly she exclaimed:  ""He is coming
down again!"""
175,9,22,"She tried to close the door, but Raoul prevented her; for he had seen,
on the top step of the staircase that led to the floor above, A RED
FOOT, followed by another ... and slowly, majestically, the whole
scarlet dress of Red Death met his eyes.  And he once more saw the
death's head of Perros - Guirec."
175,9,23,"""It's he!"" he exclaimed.  ""This time, he shall not escape me! ..."""
175,9,24,"But Christian{sic} had slammed the door at the moment when Raoul was on
the point of rushing out.  He tried to push her aside."
175,9,25,"""Whom do you mean by 'he'?"" she asked, in a changed voice.  ""Who shall
not escape you?"""
175,9,26,"Raoul tried to overcome the girl's resistance by force, but she
repelled him with a strength which he would not have suspected in her.
He understood, or thought he understood, and at once lost his temper."
175,9,27,"""Who?"" he repeated angrily.  ""Why, he, the man who hides behind that
hideous mask of death! ... The evil genius of the churchyard at Perros!
... Red Death! ... In a word, madam, your friend ...  your Angel of
Music! ... But I shall snatch off his mask, as I shall snatch off my
own; and, this time, we shall look each other in the face, he and I,
with no veil and no lies between us; and I shall know whom you love and
who loves you!"""
175,9,28,"He burst into a mad laugh, while Christine gave a disconsolate moan
behind her velvet mask.  With a tragic gesture, she flung out her two
arms, which fixed a barrier of white flesh against the door."
175,9,29,"""In the name of our love, Raoul, you shall not pass! ..."""
175,9,30,"He stopped.  What had she said? ... In the name of their love? ...
Never before had she confessed that she loved him.  And yet she had had
opportunities enough ...  Pooh, her only object was to gain a few
seconds! ... She wished to give the Red Death time to escape ...  And,
in accents of childish hatred, he said:"
175,9,31,"""You lie, madam, for you do not love me and you have never loved me!
What a poor fellow I must be to let you mock and flout me as you have
done!  Why did you give me every reason for hope, at Perros ...  for
honest hope, madam, for I am an honest man and I believed you to be an
honest woman, when your only intention was to deceive me!  Alas, you
have deceived us all!  You have taken a shameful advantage of the
candid affection of your benefactress herself, who continues to believe
in your sincerity while you go about the Opera ball with Red Death! ...
I despise you! ..."""
175,9,32,"And he burst into tears.  She allowed him to insult her.  She thought
of but one thing, to keep him from leaving the box."
175,9,33,"""You will beg my pardon, one day, for all those ugly words, Raoul, and
when you do I shall forgive you!"""
175,9,34,"He shook his head.  ""No, no, you have driven me mad!  When I think that
I had only one object in life:  to give my name to an opera wench!"""
175,9,35,"""Raoul! ... How can you?"""
175,9,36,"""I shall die of shame!"""
175,9,37,"""No, dear, live!"" said Christine's grave and changed voice.  ""And ...
good - by. Good - by, Raoul ..."""
175,9,38,"The boy stepped forward, staggering as he went.  He risked one more
sarcasm:"
175,9,39,"""Oh, you must let me come and applaud you from time to time!"""
175,9,40,"""I shall never sing again, Raoul! ..."""
175,9,41,"""Really?"" he replied, still more satirically.  ""So he is taking you off
the stage:  I congratulate you! ... But we shall meet in the Bois, one
of these evenings!"""
175,9,42,"""Not in the Bois nor anywhere, Raoul:  you shall not see me again ..."""
175,9,43,"""May one ask at least to what darkness you are returning? ... For what
hell are you leaving, mysterious lady ... or for what paradise?"""
175,9,44,"""I came to tell you, dear, but I can't tell you now ... you would not
believe me!  You have lost faith in me, Raoul; it is finished!"""
175,9,45,"She spoke in such a despairing voice that the lad began to feel remorse
for his cruelty."
175,9,46,"""But look here!"" he cried.  ""Can't you tell me what all this means!
...  You are free, there is no one to interfere with you...  You go
about Paris ...  You put on a domino to come to the ball...  Why do you
not go home? ... What have you been doing this past fortnight? ... What
is this tale about the Angel of Music, which you have been telling
Mamma Valerius?  Some one may have taken you in, played upon your
innocence.  I was a witness of it myself, at Perros ... but you know
what to believe now!  You seem to me quite sensible, Christine.  You
know what you are doing ...  And meanwhile Mamma Valerius lies waiting
for you at home and appealing to your 'good genius!' ... Explain
yourself, Christine, I beg of you!  Any one might have been deceived as
I was.  What is this farce?"""
175,9,47,"Christine simply took off her mask and said:  ""Dear, it is a tragedy!"""
175,9,48,"Raoul now saw her face and could not restrain an exclamation of
surprise and terror.  The fresh complexion of former days was gone.  A
mortal pallor covered those features, which he had known so charming
and so gentle, and sorrow had furrowed them with pitiless lines and
traced dark and unspeakably sad shadows under her eyes."
175,9,49,"""My dearest!  My dearest!"" he moaned, holding out his arms.  ""You
promised to forgive me ..."""
175,9,50,"""Perhaps! ... Some day, perhaps!"" she said, resuming her mask; and she
went away, forbidding him, with a gesture, to follow her."
175,9,51,"He tried to disobey her; but she turned round and repeated her gesture
of farewell with such authority that he dared not move a step."
175,9,52,"He watched her till she was out of sight.  Then he also went down among
the crowd, hardly knowing what he was doing, with throbbing temples and
an aching heart; and, as he crossed the dancing - floor, he asked if
anybody had seen Red Death.  Yes, every one had seen Red Death; but
Raoul could not find him; and, at two o'clock in the morning, he turned
down the passage, behind the scenes, that led to Christine Daae's
dressing - room."
175,9,53,"His footsteps took him to that room where he had first known suffering.
He tapped at the door.  There was no answer.  He entered, as he had
entered when he looked everywhere for ""the man's voice."" The room was
empty.  A gas - jet was burning, turned down low.  He saw some
writing - paper on a little desk.  He thought of writing to Christine,
but he heard steps in the passage.  He had only time to hide in the
inner room, which was separated from the dressing - room by a curtain."
175,9,54,"Christine entered, took off her mask with a weary movement and flung it
on the table.  She sighed and let her pretty head fall into her two
hands.  What was she thinking of?  Of Raoul?  No, for Raoul heard her
murmur:  ""Poor Erik!"""
175,9,55,"At first, he thought he must be mistaken.  To begin with, he was
persuaded that, if any one was to be pitied, it was he, Raoul.  It
would have been quite natural if she had said, ""Poor Raoul,"" after what
had happened between them.  But, shaking her head, she repeated:  ""Poor
Erik!"""
175,9,56,"What had this Erik to do with Christine's sighs and why was she pitying
Erik when Raoul was so unhappy?"
175,9,57,"Christine began to write, deliberately, calmly and so placidly that
Raoul, who was still trembling from the effects of the tragedy that
separated them, was painfully impressed."
175,9,58,"""What coolness!"" he said to himself."
175,9,59,"She wrote on, filling two, three, four sheets.  Suddenly, she raised
her head and hid the sheets in her bodice ... She seemed to be
listening ...  Raoul also listened ...  Whence came that strange sound,
that distant rhythm? ... A faint singing seemed to issue from the walls
... yes, it was as though the walls themselves were singing! ... The
song became plainer ... the words were now distinguishable ... he heard
a voice, a very beautiful, very soft, very captivating voice ... but,
for all its softness, it remained a male voice ... The voice came
nearer and nearer ... it came through the wall ... it approached ...
and now the voice was IN THE ROOM, in front of Christine.  Christine
rose and addressed the voice, as though speaking to some one:"
175,9,60,"""Here I am, Erik,"" she said.  ""I am ready.  But you are late."""
175,9,61,"Raoul, peeping from behind the curtain, could not believe his eyes,
which showed him nothing.  Christine's face lit up.  A smile of
happiness appeared upon her bloodless lips, a smile like that of sick
people when they receive the first hope of recovery."
175,9,62,"The voice without a body went on singing; and certainly Raoul had never
in his life heard anything more absolutely and heroically sweet, more
gloriously insidious, more delicate, more powerful, in short, more
irresistibly triumphant.  He listened to it in a fever and he now began
to understand how Christine Daae was able to appear one evening, before
the stupefied audience, with accents of a beauty hitherto unknown, of a
superhuman exaltation, while doubtless still under the influence of the
mysterious and invisible master."
175,9,63,"The voice was singing the Wedding - night Song from Romeo and Juliet.
Raoul saw Christine stretch out her arms to the voice as she had done,
in Perros churchyard, to the invisible violin playing The Resurrection
of Lazarus.  And nothing could describe the passion with which the
voice sang:"
175,9,64,"""Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!"""
175,9,65,"The strains went through Raoul's heart.  Struggling against the charm
that seemed to deprive him of all his will and all his energy and of
almost all his lucidity at the moment when he needed them most, he
succeeded in drawing back the curtain that hid him and he walked to
where Christine stood.  She herself was moving to the back of the room,
the whole wall of which was occupied by a great mirror that reflected
her image, but not his, for he was just behind her and entirely covered
by her."
175,9,66,"""Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!"""
175,9,67,"Christine walked toward her image in the glass and the image came
toward her.  The two Christines -  - the real one and the reflection -  - ended
by touching; and Raoul put out his arms to clasp the two in one
embrace.  But, by a sort of dazzling miracle that sent him staggering,
Raoul was suddenly flung back, while an icy blast swept over his face;
he saw, not two, but four, eight, twenty Christines spinning round him,
laughing at him and fleeing so swiftly that he could not touch one of
them.  At last, everything stood still again; and he saw himself in the
glass.  But Christine had disappeared."
175,9,68,"He rushed up to the glass.  He struck at the walls.  Nobody!  And
meanwhile the room still echoed with a distant passionate singing:"
175,9,69,"""Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!"""
175,9,70,"Which way, which way had Christine gone? ... Which way would she
return? ..."
175,9,71,"Would she return?  Alas, had she not declared to him that everything
was finished?  And was the voice not repeating:"
175,9,72,"""Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!"""
175,9,73,To me?  To whom?
175,9,74,"Then, worn out, beaten, empty - brained, he sat down on the chair which
Christine had just left.  Like her, he let his head fall into his
hands.  When he raised it, the tears were streaming down his young
cheeks, real, heavy tears like those which jealous children shed, tears
that wept for a sorrow which was in no way fanciful, but which is
common to all the lovers on earth and which he expressed aloud:"
175,9,75,"""Who is this Erik?"" he said."
175,10,1,"The day after Christine had vanished before his eyes in a sort of
dazzlement that still made him doubt the evidence of his senses, M. le
Vicomte de Chagny called to inquire at Mamma Valerius'.  He came upon a
charming picture.  Christine herself was seated by the bedside of the
old lady, who was sitting up against the pillows, knitting.  The pink
and white had returned to the young girl's cheeks.  The dark rings
round her eyes had disappeared.  Raoul no longer recognized the tragic
face of the day before.  If the veil of melancholy over those adorable
features had not still appeared to the young man as the last trace of
the weird drama in whose toils that mysterious child was struggling, he
could have believed that Christine was not its heroine at all."
175,10,2,"She rose, without showing any emotion, and offered him her hand.  But
Raoul's stupefaction was so great that he stood there dumfounded,
without a gesture, without a word."
175,10,3,"""Well, M. de Chagny,"" exclaimed Mamma Valerius, ""don't you know our
Christine?  Her good genius has sent her back to us!"""
175,10,4,"""Mamma!"" the girl broke in promptly, while a deep blush mantled to her
eyes.  ""I thought, mamma, that there was to be no more question of
that! ... You know there is no such thing as the Angel of Music!"""
175,10,5,"""But, child, he gave you lessons for three months!"""
175,10,6,"""Mamma, I have promised to explain everything to you one of these days;
and I hope to do so but you have promised me, until that day, to be
silent and to ask me no more questions whatever!"""
175,10,7,"""Provided that you promised never to leave me again!  But have you
promised that, Christine?"""
175,10,8,"""Mamma, all this can not interest M. de Chagny."""
175,10,9,"""On the contrary, mademoiselle,"" said the young man, in a voice which
he tried to make firm and brave, but which still trembled, ""anything
that concerns you interests me to an extent which perhaps you will one
day understand.  I do not deny that my surprise equals my pleasure at
finding you with your adopted mother and that, after what happened
between us yesterday, after what you said and what I was able to guess,
I hardly expected to see you here so soon.  I should be the first to
delight at your return, if you were not so bent on preserving a secrecy
that may be fatal to you ... and I have been your friend too long not
to be alarmed, with Mme. Valerius, at a disastrous adventure which will
remain dangerous so long as we have not unraveled its threads and of
which you will certainly end by being the victim, Christine."""
175,10,10,"At these words, Mamma Valerius tossed about in her bed."
175,10,11,"""What does this mean?"" she cried.  ""Is Christine in danger?"""
175,10,12,"""Yes, madame,"" said Raoul courageously, notwithstanding the signs which
Christine made to him."
175,10,13,"""My God!"" exclaimed the good, simple old woman, gasping for breath.
""You must tell me everything, Christine!  Why did you try to reassure
me?  And what danger is it, M. de Chagny?"""
175,10,14,"""An impostor is abusing her good faith."""
175,10,15,"""Is the Angel of Music an impostor?"""
175,10,16,"""She told you herself that there is no Angel of Music."""
175,10,17,"""But then what is it, in Heaven's name?  You will be the death of me!"""
175,10,18,"""There is a terrible mystery around us, madame, around you, around
Christine, a mystery much more to be feared than any number of ghosts
or genii!"""
175,10,19,"Mamma Valerius turned a terrified face to Christine, who had already
run to her adopted mother and was holding her in her arms."
175,10,20,"""Don't believe him, mummy, don't believe him,"" she repeated."
175,10,21,"""Then tell me that you will never leave me again,"" implored the widow."
175,10,22,Christine was silent and Raoul resumed.
175,10,23,"""That is what you must promise, Christine.  It is the only thing that
can reassure your mother and me.  We will undertake not to ask you a
single question about the past, if you promise us to remain under our
protection in future."""
175,10,24,"""That is an undertaking which I have not asked of you and a promise
which I refuse to make you!"" said the young girl haughtily.  ""I am
mistress of my own actions, M. de Chagny: you have no right to control
them, and I will beg you to desist henceforth.  As to what I have done
during the last fortnight, there is only one man in the world who has
the right to demand an account of me: my husband!  Well, I have no
husband and I never mean to marry!"""
175,10,25,"She threw out her hands to emphasize her words and Raoul turned pale,
not only because of the words which he had heard, but because he had
caught sight of a plain gold ring on Christine's finger."
175,10,26,"""You have no husband and yet you wear a wedding - ring."""
175,10,27,"He tried to seize her hand, but she swiftly drew it back."
175,10,28,"""That's a present!"" she said, blushing once more and vainly striving to
hide her embarrassment."
175,10,29,"""Christine!  As you have no husband, that ring can only have been given
by one who hopes to make you his wife!  Why deceive us further?  Why
torture me still more?  That ring is a promise; and that promise has
been accepted!"""
175,10,30,"""That's what I said!"" exclaimed the old lady."
175,10,31,"""And what did she answer, madame?"""
175,10,32,"""What I chose,"" said Christine, driven to exasperation.  ""Don't you
think, monsieur, that this cross - examination has lasted long enough?
As far as I am concerned ..."""
175,10,33,Raoul was afraid to let her finish her speech.  He interrupted her:
175,10,34,"""I beg your pardon for speaking as I did, mademoiselle.  You know the
good intentions that make me meddle, just now, in matters which, you no
doubt think, have nothing to do with me.  But allow me to tell you what
I have seen -  - and I have seen more than you suspect, Christine -  - or what
I thought I saw, for, to tell you the truth, I have sometimes been
inclined to doubt the evidence of my eyes."""
175,10,35,"""Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?"""
175,10,36,"""I saw your ecstasy AT THE SOUND OF THE VOICE, Christine:  the voice
that came from the wall or the next room to yours ... yes, YOUR
ECSTASY!  And that is what makes me alarmed on your behalf.  You are
under a very dangerous spell.  And yet it seems that you are aware of
the imposture, because you say to - day THAT THERE IS NO ANGEL OF MUSIC!
In that case, Christine, why did you follow him that time?  Why did you
stand up, with radiant features, as though you were really hearing
angels? ... Ah, it is a very dangerous voice, Christine, for I myself,
when I heard it, was so much fascinated by it that you vanished before
my eyes without my seeing which way you passed!  Christine, Christine,
in the name of Heaven, in the name of your father who is in Heaven now
and who loved you so dearly and who loved me too, Christine, tell us,
tell your benefactress and me, to whom does that voice belong?  If you
do, we will save you in spite of yourself.  Come, Christine, the name
of the man!  The name of the man who had the audacity to put a ring on
your finger!"""
175,10,37,"""M. de Chagny,"" the girl declared coldly, ""you shall never know!"""
175,10,38,"Thereupon, seeing the hostility with which her ward had addressed the
viscount, Mamma Valerius suddenly took Christine's part."
175,10,39,"""And, if she does love that man, Monsieur le Vicomte, even then it is
no business of yours!"""
175,10,40,"""Alas, madame,"" Raoul humbly replied, unable to restrain his tears,
""alas, I believe that Christine really does love him! ... But it is not
only that which drives me to despair; for what I am not certain of,
madame, is that the man whom Christine loves is worthy of her love!"""
175,10,41,"""It is for me to be the judge of that, monsieur!"" said Christine,
looking Raoul angrily in the face."
175,10,42,"""When a man,"" continued Raoul, ""adopts such romantic methods to entice
a young girl's affections. .."""
175,10,43,"""The man must be either a villain, or the girl a fool:  is that it?"""
175,10,44,"""Christine!"""
175,10,45,"""Raoul, why do you condemn a man whom you have never seen, whom no one
knows and about whom you yourself know nothing?"""
175,10,46,"""Yes, Christine ...  Yes ...  I at least know the name that you thought
to keep from me for ever ...  The name of your Angel of Music,
mademoiselle, is Erik!"""
175,10,47,"Christine at once betrayed herself.  She turned as white as a sheet and
stammered:  ""Who told you?"""
175,10,48,"""You yourself!"""
175,10,49,"""How do you mean?"""
175,10,50,"""By pitying him the other night, the night of the masked ball.  When
you went to your dressing - room, did you not say, 'Poor Erik?' Well,
Christine, there was a poor Raoul who overheard you."""
175,10,51,"""This is the second time that you have listened behind the door, M. de
Chagny!"""
175,10,52,"""I was not behind the door ... I was in the dressing - room, in the inner
room, mademoiselle."""
175,10,53,"""Oh, unhappy man!"" moaned the girl, showing every sign of unspeakable
terror.  ""Unhappy man!  Do you want to be killed?"""
175,10,54,"""Perhaps."""
175,10,55,"Raoul uttered this ""perhaps"" with so much love and despair in his voice
that Christine could not keep back a sob.  She took his hands and
looked at him with all the pure affection of which she was capable:"
175,10,56,"""Raoul,"" she said, ""forget THE MAN'S VOICE and do not even remember its
name... You must never try to fathom the mystery of THE MAN'S VOICE."""
175,10,57,"""Is the mystery so very terrible?"""
175,10,58,"""There is no more awful mystery on this earth.  Swear to me that you
will make no attempt to find out,"" she insisted.  ""Swear to me that you
will never come to my dressing - room, unless I send for you."""
175,10,59,"""Then you promise to send for me sometimes, Christine?"""
175,10,60,"""I promise."""
175,10,61,"""When?"""
175,10,62,"""To - morrow."""
175,10,63,"""Then I swear to do as you ask."""
175,10,64,"He kissed her hands and went away, cursing Erik and resolving to be
patient."
175,11,1,"The next day, he saw her at the Opera.  She was still wearing the plain
gold ring.  She was gentle and kind to him.  She talked to him of the
plans which he was forming, of his future, of his career."
175,11,2,"He told her that the date of the Polar expedition had been put forward
and that he would leave France in three weeks, or a month at latest.
She suggested, almost gaily, that he must look upon the voyage with
delight, as a stage toward his coming fame.  And when he replied that
fame without love was no attraction in his eyes, she treated him as a
child whose sorrows were only short - lived."
175,11,3,"""How can you speak so lightly of such serious things?"" he asked.
""Perhaps we shall never see each other again!  I may die during that
expedition."""
175,11,4,"""Or I,"" she said simply."
175,11,5,"She no longer smiled or jested.  She seemed to be thinking of some new
thing that had entered her mind for the first time.  Her eyes were all
aglow with it."
175,11,6,"""What are you thinking of, Christine?"""
175,11,7,"""I am thinking that we shall not see each other again ..."""
175,11,8,"""And does that make you so radiant?"""
175,11,9,"""And that, in a month, we shall have to say good - by for ever!"""
175,11,10,"""Unless, Christine, we pledge our faith and wait for each other for
ever."""
175,11,11,She put her hand on his mouth.
175,11,12,"""Hush, Raoul! ... You know there is no question of that ...  And we
shall never be married:  that is understood!"""
175,11,13,"She seemed suddenly almost unable to contain an overpowering gaiety.
She clapped her hands with childish glee.  Raoul stared at her in
amazement."
175,11,14,"""But ... but,"" she continued, holding out her two hands to Raoul, or
rather giving them to him, as though she had suddenly resolved to make
him a present of them, ""but if we can not be married, we can ... we can
be engaged!  Nobody will know but ourselves, Raoul.  There have been
plenty of secret marriages:  why not a secret engagement? ... We are
engaged, dear, for a month!  In a month, you will go away, and I can be
happy at the thought of that month all my life long!"""
175,11,15,She was enchanted with her inspiration.  Then she became serious again.
175,11,16,"""This,"" she said, ""IS A HAPPINESS THAT WILL HARM NO ONE."""
175,11,17,Raoul jumped at the idea.  He bowed to Christine and said:
175,11,18,"""Mademoiselle, I have the honor to ask for your hand."""
175,11,19,"""Why, you have both of them already, my dear betrothed! ...  Oh, Raoul,
how happy we shall be! ... We must play at being engaged all day long."""
175,11,20,"It was the prettiest game in the world and they enjoyed it like the
children that they were.  Oh, the wonderful speeches they made to each
other and the eternal vows they exchanged!  They played at hearts as
other children might play at ball; only, as it was really their two
hearts that they flung to and fro, they had to be very, very handy to
catch them, each time, without hurting them."
175,11,21,"One day, about a week after the game began, Raoul's heart was badly
hurt and he stopped playing and uttered these wild words:"
175,11,22,"""I shan't go to the North Pole!"""
175,11,23,"Christine, who, in her innocence, had not dreamed of such a
possibility, suddenly discovered the danger of the game and reproached
herself bitterly.  She did not say a word in reply to Raoul's remark
and went straight home."
175,11,24,"This happened in the afternoon, in the singer's dressing - room, where
they met every day and where they amused themselves by dining on three
biscuits, two glasses of port and a bunch of violets.  In the evening,
she did not sing; and he did not receive his usual letter, though they
had arranged to write to each other daily during that month.  The next
morning, he ran off to Mamma Valerius, who told him that Christine had
gone away for two days.  She had left at five o'clock the day before."
175,11,25,"Raoul was distracted.  He hated Mamma Valerius for giving him such news
as that with such stupefying calmness.  He tried to sound her, but the
old lady obviously knew nothing."
175,11,26,"Christine returned on the following day.  She returned in triumph.  She
renewed her extraordinary success of the gala performance.  Since the
adventure of the ""toad,"" Carlotta had not been able to appear on the
stage.  The terror of a fresh ""co - ack"" filled her heart and deprived
her of all her power of singing; and the theater that had witnessed her
incomprehensible disgrace had become odious to her.  She contrived to
cancel her contract.  Daae was offered the vacant place for the time.
She received thunders of applause in the Juive."
175,11,27,"The viscount, who, of course, was present, was the only one to suffer
on hearing the thousand echoes of this fresh triumph; for Christine
still wore her plain gold ring.  A distant voice whispered in the young
man's ear:"
175,11,28,"""She is wearing the ring again to - night; and you did not give it to
her.  She gave her soul again tonight and did not give it to you...  If
she will not tell you what she has been doing the past two days ... you
must go and ask Erik!"""
175,11,29,"He ran behind the scenes and placed himself in her way.  She saw him
for her eyes were looking for him.  She said:"
175,11,30,"""Quick!  Quick! ... Come!"""
175,11,31,And she dragged him to her dressing - room.
175,11,32,"Raoul at once threw himself on his knees before her.  He swore to her
that he would go and he entreated her never again to withhold a single
hour of the ideal happiness which she had promised him.  She let her
tears flow.  They kissed like a despairing brother and sister who have
been smitten with a common loss and who meet to mourn a dead parent."
175,11,33,"Suddenly, she snatched herself from the young man's soft and timid
embrace, seemed to listen to something, and, with a quick gesture,
pointed to the door.  When he was on the threshold, she said, in so low
a voice that the viscount guessed rather than heard her words:"
175,11,34,"""To - morrow, my dear betrothed!  And be happy, Raoul:  I sang for you
to - night!"""
175,11,35,"He returned the next day.  But those two days of absence had broken the
charm of their delightful make - believe. They looked at each other, in
the dressing - room, with their sad eyes, without exchanging a word.
Raoul had to restrain himself not to cry out:"
175,11,36,"""I am jealous!  I am jealous!  I am jealous!"""
175,11,37,But she heard him all the same.  Then she said:
175,11,38,"""Come for a walk, dear.  The air will do you good."""
175,11,39,"Raoul thought that she would propose a stroll in the country, far from
that building which he detested as a prison whose jailer he could feel
walking within the walls ... the jailer Erik ...  But she took him to
the stage and made him sit on the wooden curb of a well, in the
doubtful peace and coolness of a first scene set for the evening's
performance."
175,11,40,"On another day, she wandered with him, hand in, hand, along the
deserted paths of a garden whose creepers had been cut out by a
decorator's skilful hands.  It was as though the real sky, the real
flowers, the real earth were forbidden her for all time and she
condemned to breathe no other air than that of the theater.  An
occasional fireman passed, watching over their melancholy idyll from
afar.  And she would drag him up above the clouds, in the magnificent
disorder of the grid, where she loved to make him giddy by running in
front of him along the frail bridges, among the thousands of ropes
fastened to the pulleys, the windlasses, the rollers, in the midst of a
regular forest of yards and masts.  If he hesitated, she said, with an
adorable pout of her lips:"
175,11,41,"""You, a sailor!"""
175,11,42,"And then they returned to terra firma, that is to say, to some passage
that led them to the little girls' dancing - school, where brats between
six and ten were practising their steps, in the hope of becoming great
dancers one day, ""covered with diamonds ..."" Meanwhile, Christine gave
them sweets instead."
175,11,43,"She took him to the wardrobe and property - rooms, took him all over her
empire, which was artificial, but immense, covering seventeen stories
from the ground - floor to the roof and inhabited by an army of subjects.
She moved among them like a popular queen, encouraging them in their
labors, sitting down in the workshops, giving words of advice to the
workmen whose hands hesitated to cut into the rich stuffs that were to
clothe heroes.  There were inhabitants of that country who practised
every trade.  There were cobblers, there were goldsmiths.  All had
learned to know her and to love her, for she always interested herself
in all their troubles and all their little hobbies."
175,11,44,"She knew unsuspected corners that were secretly occupied by little old
couples.  She knocked at their door and introduced Raoul to them as a
Prince Charming who had asked for her hand; and the two of them,
sitting on some worm - eaten ""property,"" would listen to the legends of
the Opera, even as, in their childhood, they had listened to the old
Breton tales.  Those old people remembered nothing outside the Opera.
They had lived there for years without number.  Past managements had
forgotten them; palace revolutions had taken no notice of them; the
history of France had run its course unknown to them; and nobody
recollected their existence."
175,11,45,"The precious days sped in this way; and Raoul and Christine, by
affecting excessive interest in outside matters, strove awkwardly to
hide from each other the one thought of their hearts.  One fact was
certain, that Christine, who until then had shown herself the stronger
of the two, became suddenly inexpressibly nervous.  When on their
expeditions, she would start running without reason or else suddenly
stop; and her hand, turning ice - cold in a moment, would hold the young
man back.  Sometimes her eyes seemed to pursue imaginary shadows.  She
cried, ""This way,"" and ""This way,"" and ""This way,"" laughing a
breathless laugh that often ended in tears.  Then Raoul tried to speak,
to question her, in spite of his promises.  But, even before he had
worded his question, she answered feverishly:"
175,11,46,"""Nothing ... I swear it is nothing."""
175,11,47,"Once, when they were passing before an open trapdoor on the stage,
Raoul stopped over the dark cavity."
175,11,48,"""You have shown me over the upper part of your empire, Christine, but
there are strange stories told of the lower part.  Shall we go down?"""
175,11,49,"She caught him in her arms, as though she feared to see him disappear
down the black hole, and, in a trembling voice, whispered:"
175,11,50,"""Never! ... I will not have you go there! ... Besides, it's not mine
... EVERYTHING THAT IS UNDERGROUND BELONGS TO HIM!"""
175,11,51,Raoul looked her in the eyes and said roughly:
175,11,52,"""So he lives down there, does he?"""
175,11,53,"""I never said so ...  Who told you a thing like that?  Come away!  I
sometimes wonder if you are quite sane, Raoul ...  You always take
things in such an impossible way ...  Come along!  Come!"""
175,11,54,"And she literally dragged him away, for he was obstinate and wanted to
remain by the trap - door; that hole attracted him."
175,11,55,"Suddenly, the trap - door was closed and so quickly that they did not
even see the hand that worked it; and they remained quite dazed."
175,11,56,"""Perhaps HE was there,"" Raoul said, at last."
175,11,57,"She shrugged her shoulders, but did not seem easy."
175,11,58,"""No, no, it was the 'trap - door - shutters.' They must do something, you
know ...  They open and shut the trap - doors without any particular
reason ...  It's like the 'door - shutters:' they must spend their time
somehow."""
175,11,59,"""But suppose it were HE, Christine?"""
175,11,60,"""No, no!  He has shut himself up, he is working."""
175,11,61,"""Oh, really!  He's working, is he?"""
175,11,62,"""Yes, he can't open and shut the trap - doors and work at the same time.""
She shivered."
175,11,63,"""What is he working at?"""
175,11,64,"""Oh, something terrible! ... But it's all the better for us... When
he's working at that, he sees nothing; he does not eat, drink, or
breathe for days and nights at a time ... he becomes a living dead man
and has no time to amuse himself with the trap - doors."" She shivered
again.  She was still holding him in her arms.  Then she sighed and
said, in her turn:"
175,11,65,"""Suppose it were HE!"""
175,11,66,"""Are you afraid of him?"""
175,11,67,"""No, no, of course not,"" she said."
175,11,68,"For all that, on the next day and the following days, Christine was
careful to avoid the trap - doors. Her agitation only increased as the
hours passed.  At last, one afternoon, she arrived very late, with her
face so desperately pale and her eyes so desperately red, that Raoul
resolved to go to all lengths, including that which he foreshadowed
when he blurted out that he would not go on the North Pole expedition
unless she first told him the secret of the man's voice."
175,11,69,"""Hush!  Hush, in Heaven's name! Suppose HE heard you, you unfortunate
Raoul!"""
175,11,70,And Christine's eyes stared wildly at everything around her.
175,11,71,"""I will remove you from his power, Christine, I swear it.  And you
shall not think of him any more."""
175,11,72,"""Is it possible?"""
175,11,73,"She allowed herself this doubt, which was an encouragernent, while
dragging the young man up to the topmost floor of the theater, far,
very far from the trap - doors."
175,11,74,"""I shall hide you in some unknown corner of the world, where HE can not
come to look for you.  You will be safe; and then I shall go away ...
as you have sworn never to marry."""
175,11,75,"Christine seized Raoul's hands and squeezed them with incredible
rapture.  But, suddenly becoming alarmed again, she turned away her
head."
175,11,76,"""Higher!"" was all she said.  ""Higher still!"""
175,11,77,And she dragged him up toward the summit.
175,11,78,"He had a difficulty in following her.  They were soon under the very
roof, in the maze of timber - work. They slipped through the buttresses,
the rafters, the joists; they ran from beam to beam as they might have
run from tree to tree in a forest."
175,11,79,"And, despite the care which she took to look behind her at every
moment, she failed to see a shadow which followed her like her own
shadow, which stopped when she stopped, which started again when she
did and which made no more noise than a well - conducted shadow should.
As for Raoul, he saw nothing either; for, when he had Christine in
front of him, nothing interested him that happened behind."
175,12,1,"On this way, they reached the roof.  Christine tripped over it as
lightly as a swallow.  Their eyes swept the empty space between the
three domes and the triangular pediment.  She breathed freely over
Paris, the whole valley of which was seen at work below.  She called
Raoul to come quite close to her and they walked side by side along the
zinc streets, in the leaden avenues; they looked at their twin shapes
in the huge tanks, full of stagnant water, where, in the hot weather,
the little boys of the ballet, a score or so, learn to swim and dive."
175,12,2,"The shadow had followed behind them clinging to their steps; and the
two children little suspected its presence when they at last sat down,
trustingly, under the mighty protection of Apollo, who, with a great
bronze gesture, lifted his huge lyre to the heart of a crimson sky."
175,12,3,"It was a gorgeous spring evening.  Clouds, which had just received
their gossamer robe of gold and purple from the setting sun, drifted
slowly by; and Christine said to Raoul:"
175,12,4,"""Soon we shall go farther and faster than the clouds, to the end of the
world, and then you will leave me, Raoul.  But, if, when the moment
comes for you to take me away, I refuse to go with you -  - well you must
carry me off by force!"""
175,12,5,"""Are you afraid that you will change your mind, Christine?"""
175,12,6,"""I don't know,"" she said, shaking her head in an odd fashion.  ""He is a
demon!""  And she shivered and nestled in his arms with a moan.  ""I am
afraid now of going back to live with him ... in the ground!"""
175,12,7,"""What compels you to go back, Christine?"""
175,12,8,"""If I do not go back to him, terrible misfortunes may happen! ...  But
I can't do it, I can't do it! ... I know one ought to be sorry for
people who live underground ...  But he is too horrible!  And yet the
time is at hand; I have only a day left; and, if I do not go, he will
come and fetch me with his voice.  And he will drag me with him,
underground, and go on his knees before me, with his death's head.  And
he will tell me that he loves me!  And he will cry!  Oh, those tears,
Raoul, those tears in the two black eye - sockets of the death's head!  I
can not see those tears flow again!"""
175,12,9,"She wrung her hands in anguish, while Raoul pressed her to his heart."
175,12,10,"""No, no, you shall never again hear him tell you that he loves you!
You shall not see his tears!  Let us fly, Christine, let us fly at
once!"""
175,12,11,"And he tried to drag her away, then and there.  But she stopped him."
175,12,12,"""No, no,"" she said, shaking her head sadly.  ""Not now! ... It would be
too cruel ... let him hear me sing to - morrow evening ... and then we
will go away.  You must come and fetch me in my dressing - room at
midnight exactly.  He will then be waiting for me in the dining - room by
the lake ... we shall be free and you shall take me away ...  You must
promise me that, Raoul, even if I refuse; for I feel that, if I go back
this time, I shall perhaps never return."""
175,12,13,"And she gave a sigh to which it seemed to her that another sigh, behind
her, replied."
175,12,14,"""Didn't you hear?"""
175,12,15,Her teeth chattered.
175,12,16,"""No,"" said Raoul, ""I heard nothing."""
175,12,17,"""It is too terrible,"" she confessed, ""to be always trembling like this!
... And yet we run no danger here; we are at home, in the sky, in the
open air, in the light.  The sun is flaming; and night - birds can not
bear to look at the sun.  I have never seen him by daylight ... it must
be awful! ... Oh, the first time I saw him! ... I thought that he was
going to die."""
175,12,18,"""Why?"" asked Raoul, really frightened at the aspect which this strange
confidence was taking."
175,12,19,"""BECAUSE I HAD SEEN HIM!"""
175,12,20,"This time, Raoul and Christine turned round at the same time:"
175,12,21,"""There is some one in pain,"" said Raoul.  ""Perhaps some one has been
hurt.  Did you hear?"""
175,12,22,"""I can't say,"" Christine confessed.  ""Even when he is not there, my
ears are full of his sighs.  Still, if you heard ..."""
175,12,23,"They stood up and looked around them.  They were quite alone on the
immense lead roof.  They sat down again and Raoul said:"
175,12,24,"""Tell me how you saw him first."""
175,12,25,"""I had heard him for three months without seeing him.  The first time I
heard it, I thought, as you did, that that adorable voice was singing
in another room.  I went out and looked everywhere; but, as you know,
Raoul, my dressing - room is very much by itself; and I could not find
the voice outside my room, whereas it went on steadily inside.  And it
not only sang, but it spoke to me and answered my questions, like a
real man's voice, with this difference, that it was as beautiful as the
voice of an angel.  I had never got the Angel of Music whom my poor
father had promised to send me as soon as he was dead.  I really think
that Mamma Valerius was a little bit to blame.  I told her about it;
and she at once said, 'It must be the Angel; at any rate, you can do no
harm by asking him.'  I did so; and the man's voice replied that, yes,
it was the Angel's voice, the voice which I was expecting and which my
father had promised me.  From that time onward, the voice and I became
great friends.  It asked leave to give me lessons every day.  I agreed
and never failed to keep the appointment which it gave me in my
dressing - room. You have no idea, though you have heard the voice, of
what those lessons were like."""
175,12,26,"""No, I have no idea,"" said Raoul.  ""What was your accompaniment?"""
175,12,27,"""We were accompanied by a music which I do not know:  it was behind the
wall and wonderfully accurate.  The voice seemed to understand mine
exactly, to know precisely where my father had left off teaching me.
In a few weeks' time, I hardly knew myself when I sang.  I was even
frightened.  I seemed to dread a sort of witchcraft behind it; but
Mamma Valerius reassured me.  She said that she knew I was much too
simple a girl to give the devil a hold on me ...  My progress, by the
voice's own order, was kept a secret between the voice, Mamma Valerius
and myself.  It was a curious thing, but, outside the dressing - room, I
sang with my ordinary, every - day voice and nobody noticed anything.  I
did all that the voice asked.  It said, 'Wait and see:  we shall
astonish Paris!' And I waited and lived on in a sort of ecstatic dream.
It was then that I saw you for the first time one evening, in the
house.  I was so glad that I never thought of concealing my delight
when I reached my dressing - room.  Unfortunately, the voice was there
before me and soon noticed, by my air, that something had happened.  It
asked what was the matter and I saw no reason for keeping our story
secret or concealing the place which you filled in my heart.  Then the
voice was silent.  I called to it, but it did not reply; I begged and
entreated, but in vain.  I was terrified lest it had gone for good.  I
wish to Heaven it had, dear!  ... That night, I went home in a
desperate condition.  I told Mamma Valerius, who said, 'Why, of course,
the voice is jealous!'  And that, dear, first revealed to me that I
loved you."""
175,12,28,"Christine stopped and laid her head on Raoul's shoulder.  They sat like
that for a moment, in silence, and they did not see, did not perceive
the movement, at a few steps from them, of the creeping shadow of two
great black wings, a shadow that came along the roof so near, so near
them that it could have stifled them by closing over them."
175,12,29,"""The next day,"" Christine continued, with a sigh, ""I went back to my
dressing - room in a very pensive frame of mind.  The voice was there,
spoke to me with great sadness and told me plainly that, if I must
bestow my heart on earth, there was nothing for the voice to do but to
go back to Heaven.  And it said this with such an accent of HUMAN
sorrow that I ought then and there to have suspected and begun to
believe that I was the victim of my deluded senses.  But my faith in
the voice, with which the memory of my father was so closely
intermingled, remained undisturbed.  I feared nothing so much as that I
might never hear it again; I had thought about my love for you and
realized all the useless danger of it; and I did not even know if you
remembered me.  Whatever happened, your position in society forbade me
to contemplate the possibility of ever marrying you; and I swore to the
voice that you were no more than a brother to me nor ever would be and
that my heart was incapable of any earthly love.  And that, dear, was
why I refused to recognize or see you when I met you on the stage or in
the passages.  Meanwhile, the hours during which the voice taught me
were spent in a divine frenzy, until, at last, the voice said to me,
'You can now, Christine Daae, give to men a little of the music of
Heaven.' I don't know how it was that Carlotta did not come to the
theater that night nor why I was called upon to sing in her stead; but
I sang with a rapture I had never known before and I felt for a moment
as if my soul were leaving my body!"""
175,12,30,"""Oh, Christine,"" said Raoul, ""my heart quivered that night at every
accent of your voice.  I saw the tears stream down your cheeks and I
wept with you.  How could you sing, sing like that while crying?"""
175,12,31,"""I felt myself fainting,"" said Christine, ""I closed my eyes.  When I
opened them, you were by my side.  But the voice was there also, Raoul!
I was afraid for your sake and again I would not recognize you and
began to laugh when you reminded me that you had picked up my scarf in
the sea! ... Alas, there is no deceiving the voice! ... The voice
recognized you and the voice was jealous! ... It said that, if I did
not love you, I would not avoid you, but treat you like any other old
friend.  It made me scene upon scene.  At last, I said to the voice,
'That will do!  I am going to Perros to - morrow, to pray on my father's
grave, and I shall ask M. Raoul de Chagny to go with me.'  'Do as you
please,' replied the voice, 'but I shall be at Perros too, for I am
wherever you are, Christine; and, if you are still worthy of me, if you
have not lied to me, I will play you The Resurrection of Lazarus, on
the stroke of midnight, on your father's tomb and on your father's
violin.'  That, dear, was how I came to write you the letter that
brought you to Perros.  How could I have been so beguiled?  How was it,
when I saw the personal, the selfish point of view of the voice, that I
did not suspect some impostor?  Alas, I was no longer mistress of
myself:  I had become his thing!"""
175,12,32,"""But, after all,"" cried Raoul, ""you soon came to know the truth!  Why
did you not at once rid yourself of that abominable nightmare?"""
175,12,33,"""Know the truth, Raoul?  Rid myself of that nightmare?  But, my poor
boy, I was not caught in the nightmare until the day when I learned the
truth! ... Pity me, Raoul, pity me! ... You remember the terrible
evening when Carlotta thought that she had been turned into a toad on
the stage and when the house was suddenly plunged in darkness through
the chandelier crashing to the floor?  There were killed and wounded
that night and the whole theater rang with terrified screams.  My first
thought was for you and the voice.  I was at once easy, where you were
concerned, for I had seen you in your brother's box and I knew that you
were not in danger.  But the voice had told me that it would be at the
performance and I was really afraid for it, just as if it had been an
ordinary person who was capable of dying.  I thought to myself, 'The
chandelier may have come down upon the voice.'  I was then on the stage
and was nearly running into the house, to look for the voice among the
killed and wounded, when I thought that, if the voice was safe, it
would be sure to be in my dressing - room and I rushed to my room.  The
voice was not there.  I locked my door and, with tears in my eyes,
besought it, if it were still alive, to manifest itself to me.  The
voice did not reply, but suddenly I heard a long, beautiful wail which
I knew well.  It is the plaint of Lazarus when, at the sound of the
Redeemer's voice, he begins to open his eyes and see the light of day.
It was the music which you and I, Raoul, heard at Perros.  And then the
voice began to sing the leading phrase, 'Come!  And believe in me!
Whoso believes in me shall live!  Walk!  Whoso hath believed in me
shall never die! ...'  I can not tell you the effect which that music
had upon me.  It seemed to command me, personally, to come, to stand up
and come to it.  It retreated and I followed.  'Come! And believe in
me!'  I believed in it, I came ...  I came and -  - this was the
extraordinary thing -  - my dressing - room, as I moved, seemed to lengthen
out ... to lengthen out ...  Evidently, it must have been an effect of
mirrors ... for I had the mirror in front of me ...  And, suddenly, I
was outside the room without knowing how!"""
175,12,34,"""What!  Without knowing how?  Christine, Christine, you must really
stop dreaming!"""
175,12,35,"""I was not dreaming, dear, I was outside my room without knowing how.
You, who saw me disappear from my room one evening, may be able to
explain it; but I can not.  I can only tell you that, suddenly, there
was no mirror before me and no dressing - room.  I was in a dark passage,
I was frightened and I cried out.  It was quite dark, but for a faint
red glimmer at a distant corner of the wall.  I tried out.  My voice
was the only sound, for the singing and the violin had stopped.  And,
suddenly, a hand was laid on mine ... or rather a stone - cold, bony
thing that seized my wrist and did not let go.  I cried out again.  An
arm took me round the waist and supported me.  I struggled for a little
while and then gave up the attempt.  I was dragged toward the little
red light and then I saw that I was in the hands of a man wrapped in a
large cloak and wearing a mask that hid his whole face.  I made one
last effort; my limbs stiffened, my mouth opened to scream, but a hand
closed it, a hand which I felt on my lips, on my skin ... a hand that
smelt of death.  Then I fainted away."
175,12,36,"""When I opened my eyes, we were still surrounded by darkness.  A
lantern, standing on the ground, showed a bubbling well.  The water
splashing from the well disappeared, almost at once, under the floor on
which I was lying, with my head on the knee of the man in the black
cloak and the black mask.  He was bathing my temples and his hands
smelt of death.  I tried to push them away and asked, 'Who are you?
Where is the voice?'  His only answer was a sigh.  Suddenly, a hot
breath passed over my face and I perceived a white shape, beside the
man's black shape, in the darkness.  The black shape lifted me on to
the white shape, a glad neighing greeted my astounded ears and I
murmured, 'Cesar!' The animal quivered.  Raoul, I was lying half back
on a saddle and I had recognized the white horse out of the PROFETA,
which I had so often fed with sugar and sweets.  I remembered that, one
evening, there was a rumor in the theater that the horse had
disappeared and that it had been stolen by the Opera ghost.  I believed
in the voice, but had never believed in the ghost.  Now, however, I
began to wonder, with a shiver, whether I was the ghost's prisoner.  I
called upon the voice to help me, for I should never have imagined that
the voice and the ghost were one.  You have heard about the Opera
ghost, have you not, Raoul?"""
175,12,37,"""Yes, but tell me what happened when you were on the white horse of the
Profeta?"""
175,12,38,"""I made no movement and let myself go.  The black shape held me up, and
I made no effort to escape.  A curious feeling of peacefulness came
over me and I thought that I must be under the influence of some
cordial.  I had the full command of my senses; and my eyes became used
to the darkness, which was lit, here and there, by fitful gleams.  I
calculated that we were in a narrow circular gallery, probably running
all round the Opera, which is immense, underground.  I had once been
down into those cellars, but had stopped at the third floor, though
there were two lower still, large enough to hold a town.  But the
figures of which I caught sight had made me run away.  There are demons
down there, quite black, standing in front of boilers, and they wield
shovels and pitchforks and poke up fires and stir up flames and, if you
come too near them, they frighten you by suddenly opening the red
mouths of their furnaces ...  Well, while Cesar was quietly carrying me
on his back, I saw those black demons in the distance, looking quite
small, in front of the red fires of their furnaces: they came into
sight, disappeared and came into sight again, as we went on our winding
way.  At last, they disappeared altogether.  The shape was still
holding me up and Cesar walked on, unled and sure - footed. I could not
tell you, even approximately, how long this ride lasted; I only know
that we seemed to turn and turn and often went down a spiral stair into
the very heart of the earth.  Even then, it may be that my head was
turning, but I don't think so: no, my mind was quite clear.  At last,
Cesar raised his nostrils, sniffed the air and quickened his pace a
little.  I felt a moistness in the air and Cesar stopped.  The darkness
had lifted.  A sort of bluey light surrounded us.  We were on the edge
of a lake, whose leaden waters stretched into the distance, into the
darkness; but the blue light lit up the bank and I saw a little boat
fastened to an iron ring on the wharf!"""
175,12,39,"""A boat!"""
175,12,40,"""Yes, but I knew that all that existed and that there was nothing
supernatural about that underground lake and boat.  But think of the
exceptional conditions in which I arrived upon that shore!  I don't
know whether the effects of the cordial had worn off when the man's
shape lifted me into the boat, but my terror began all over again.  My
gruesome escort must have noticed it, for he sent Cesar back and I
heard his hoofs trampling up a staircase while the man jumped into the
boat, untied the rope that held it and seized the oars.  He rowed with
a quick, powerful stroke; and his eyes, under the mask, never left me.
We slipped across the noiseless water in the bluey light which I told
you of; then we were in the dark again and we touched shore.  And I was
once more taken up in the man's arms.  I cried aloud.  And then,
suddenly, I was silent, dazed by the light... Yes, a dazzling light in
the midst of which I had been put down.  I sprang to my feet.  I was in
the middle of a drawing - room that seemed to me to be decorated, adorned
and furnished with nothing but flowers, flowers both magnificent and
stupid, because of the silk ribbons that tied them to baskets, like
those which they sell in the shops on the boulevards.  They were much
too civilized flowers, like those which I used to find in my
dressing - room after a first night.  And, in the midst of all these
flowers, stood the black shape of the man in the mask, with arms
crossed, and he said, 'Don't be afraid, Christine; you are in no
danger.' IT WAS THE VOICE!"
175,12,41,"""My anger equaled my amazement.  I rushed at the mask and tried to
snatch it away, so as to see the face of the voice.  The man said, 'You
are in no danger, so long as you do not touch the mask.' And, taking me
gently by the wrists, he forced me into a chair and then went down on
his knees before me and said nothing more!  His humility gave me back
some of my courage; and the light restored me to the realties of life.
However extraordinary the adventure might be, I was now surrounded by
mortal, visible, tangible things.  The furniture, the hangings, the
candles, the vases and the very flowers in their baskets, of which I
could almost have told whence they came and what they cost, were bound
to confine my imagination to the limits of a drawing - room quite as
commonplace as any that, at least, had the excuse of not being in the
cellars of the Opera.  I had, no doubt, to do with a terrible,
eccentric person, who, in some mysterious fashion, had succeeded in
taking up his abode there, under the Opera house, five stories below
the level of the ground.  And the voice, the voice which I had
recognized under the mask, was on its knees before me, WAS A MAN!  And
I began to cry...  The man, still kneeling, must have understood the
cause of my tears, for he said, 'It is true, Christine! ... I am not an
Angel, nor a genius, nor a ghost ... I am Erik!'"""
175,12,42,"Christine's narrative was again interrupted.  An echo behind them
seemed to repeat the word after her."
175,12,43,"""Erik!"""
175,12,44,"What echo? ... They both turned round and saw that night had fallen.
Raoul made a movement as though to rise, but Christine kept him beside
her."
175,12,45,"""Don't go,"" she said.  ""I want you to know everything HERE!"""
175,12,46,"""But why here, Christine?  I am afraid of your catching cold."""
175,12,47,"""We have nothing to fear except the trap - doors, dear, and here we are
miles away from the trap - doors ... and I am not allowed to see you
outside the theater.  This is not the time to annoy him.  We must not
arouse his suspicion."""
175,12,48,"""Christine!  Christine!  Something tells me that we are wrong to wait
till to - morrow evening and that we ought to fly at once."""
175,12,49,"""I tell you that, if he does not hear me sing tomorrow, it will cause
him infinite pain."""
175,12,50,"""It is difficult not to cause him pain and yet to escape from him for
good."""
175,12,51,"""You are right in that, Raoul, for certainly he will die of my flight.""
And she added in a dull voice, ""But then it counts both ways ...  for
we risk his killing us."""
175,12,52,"""Does he love you so much?"""
175,12,53,"""He would commit murder for me."""
175,12,54,"""But one can find out where he lives.  One can go in search of him.
Now that we know that Erik is not a ghost, one can speak to him and
force him to answer!"""
175,12,55,Christine shook her head.
175,12,56,"""No, no!  There is nothing to be done with Erik except to run away!"""
175,12,57,"""Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?"""
175,12,58,"""Because I had to.  And you will understand that when I tell you how I
left him."""
175,12,59,"""Oh, I hate him!"" cried Raoul.  ""And you, Christine, tell me, do you
hate him too?"""
175,12,60,"""No,"" said Christine simply."
175,12,61,"""No, of course not ...  Why, you love him!  Your fear, your terror, all
of that is just love and love of the most exquisite kind, the kind
which people do not admit even to themselves,"" said Raoul bitterly.
""The kind that gives you a thrill, when you think of it...  Picture it:
a man who lives in a palace underground!"" And he gave a leer."
175,12,62,"""Then you want me to go back there?"" said the young girl cruelly.
""Take care, Raoul; I have told you:  I should never return!"""
175,12,63,"There was an appalling silence between the three of them: the two who
spoke and the shadow that listened, behind them."
175,12,64,"""Before answering that,"" said Raoul, at last, speaking very slowly, ""I
should like to know with what feeling he inspires you, since you do not
hate him."""
175,12,65,"""With horror!"" she said.  ""That is the terrible thing about it.  He
fills me with horror and I do not hate him.  How can I hate him, Raoul?
Think of Erik at my feet, in the house on the lake, underground.  He
accuses himself, he curses himself, he implores my forgiveness! ... He
confesses his cheat.  He loves me!  He lays at my feet an immense and
tragic love...  He has carried me off for love! ... He has imprisoned
me with him, underground, for love! ... But he respects me:  he crawls,
he moans, he weeps! ... And, when I stood up, Raoul, and told him that
I could only despise him if he did not, then and there, give me my
liberty ... he offered it ... he offered to show me the mysterious road
... Only ... only he rose too ... and I was made to remember that,
though he was not an angel, nor a ghost, nor a genius, he remained the
voice ... for he sang.  And I listened ... and stayed! ... That night,
we did not exchange another word.  He sang me to sleep."
175,12,66,"""When I woke up, I was alone, lying on a sofa in a simply furnished
little bedroom, with an ordinary mahogany bedstead, lit by a lamp
standing on the marble top of an old Louis - Philippe chest of drawers.
I soon discovered that I was a prisoner and that the only outlet from
my room led to a very comfortable bath - room. On returning to the
bedroom, I saw on the chest of drawers a note, in red ink, which said,
'My dear Christine, you need have no concern as to your fate.  You have
no better nor more respectful friend in the world than myself.  You are
alone, at present, in this home which is yours.  I am going out
shopping to fetch you all the things that you can need.' I felt sure
that I had fallen into the hands of a madman.  I ran round my little
apartment, looking for a way of escape which I could not find.  I
upbraided myself for my absurd superstition, which had caused me to
fall into the trap.  I felt inclined to laugh and to cry at the same
time."
175,12,67,"""This was the state of mind in which Erik found me.  After giving three
taps on the wall, he walked in quietly through a door which I had not
noticed and which he left open.  He had his arms full of boxes and
parcels and arranged them on the bed, in a leisurely fashion, while I
overwhelmed him with abuse and called upon him to take off his mask, if
it covered the face of an honest man.  He replied serenely, 'You shall
never see Erik's face.'  And he reproached me with not having finished
dressing at that time of day: he was good enough to tell me that it was
two o'clock in the afternoon.  He said he would give me half an hour
and, while he spoke, wound up my watch and set it for me.  After which,
he asked me to come to the dining - room, where a nice lunch was waiting
for us."
175,12,68,"""I was very angry, slammed the door in his face and went to the
bath - room ...  When I came out again, feeling greatly refreshed, Erik
said that he loved me, but that he would never tell me so except when I
allowed him and that the rest of the time would be devoted to music.
'What do you mean by the rest of the time?' I asked.  'Five days,' he
said, with decision.  I asked him if I should then be free and he said,
'You will be free, Christine, for, when those five days are past, you
will have learned not to see me; and then, from time to time, you will
come to see your poor Erik!' He pointed to a chair opposite him, at a
small table, and I sat down, feeling greatly perturbed.  However, I ate
a few prawns and the wing of a chicken and drank half a glass of tokay,
which he had himself, he told me, brought from the Konigsberg cellars.
Erik did not eat or drink.  I asked him what his nationality was and if
that name of Erik did not point to his Scandinavian origin.  He said
that he had no name and no country and that he had taken the name of
Erik by accident."
175,12,69,"""After lunch, he rose and gave me the tips of his fingers, saying he
would like to show me over his flat; but I snatched away my hand and
gave a cry.  What I had touched was cold and, at the same time, bony;
and I remembered that his hands smelt of death.  'Oh, forgive me!' he
moaned.  And he opened a door before me.  'This is my bedroom, if you
care to see it.  It is rather curious.' His manners, his words, his
attitude gave me confidence and I went in without hesitation.  I felt
as if I were entering the room of a dead person.  The walls were all
hung with black, but, instead of the white trimmings that usually set
off that funereal upholstery, there was an enormous stave of music with
the notes of the DIES IRAE, many times repeated.  In the middle of the
room was a canopy, from which hung curtains of red brocaded stuff, and,
under the canopy, an open coffin.  'That is where I sleep,' said Erik.
'One has to get used to everything in life, even to eternity.'  The
sight upset me so much that I turned away my head."
175,12,70,"""Then I saw the keyboard of an organ which filled one whole side of the
walls.  On the desk was a music - book covered with red notes.  I asked
leave to look at it and read, 'Don Juan Triumphant.' 'Yes,' he said, 'I
compose sometimes.'  I began that work twenty years ago.  When I have
finished, I shall take it away with me in that coffin and never wake up
again.'  'You must work at it as seldom as you can,' I said.  He
replied, 'I sometimes work at it for fourteen days and nights together,
during which I live on music only, and then I rest for years at a
time.'  'Will you play me something out of your Don Juan Triumphant?' I
asked, thinking to please him.  'You must never ask me that,' he said,
in a gloomy voice.  'I will play you Mozart, if you like, which will
only make you weep; but my Don Juan, Christine, burns; and yet he is
not struck by fire from Heaven.'  Thereupon we returned to the
drawing - room. I noticed that there was no mirror in the whole
apartment.  I was going to remark upon this, but Erik had already sat
down to the piano.  He said, 'You see, Christine, there is some music
that is so terrible that it consumes all those who approach it.
Fortunately, you have not come to that music yet, for you would lose
all your pretty coloring and nobody would know you when you returned to
Paris.  Let us sing something from the Opera, Christine Daae.' He spoke
these last words as though he were flinging an insult at me."""
175,12,71,"""What did you do?"""
175,12,72,"""I had no time to think about the meaning he put into his words.  We at
once began the duet in Othello and already the catastrophe was upon us.
I sang Desdemona with a despair, a terror which I had never displayed
before.  As for him, his voice thundered forth his revengeful soul at
every note.  Love, jealousy, hatred, burst out around us in harrowing
cries.  Erik's black mask made me think of the natural mask of the Moor
of Venice.  He was Othello himself.  Suddenly, I felt a need to see
beneath the mask.  I wanted to know the FACE of the voice, and, with a
movement which I was utterly unable to control, swiftly my fingers tore
away the mask.  Oh, horror, horror, horror!"""
175,12,73,"Christine stopped, at the thought of the vision that had scared her,
while the echoes of the night, which had repeated the name of Erik, now
thrice moaned the cry:"
175,12,74,"""Horror! ... Horror! ... Horror!"""
175,12,75,"Raoul and Christine, clasping each other closely, raised their eyes to
the stars that shone in a clear and peaceful sky.  Raoul said:"
175,12,76,"""Strange, Christine, that this calm, soft night should be so full of
plaintive sounds.  One would think that it was sorrowing with us."""
175,12,77,"""When you know the secret, Raoul, your ears, like mine, will be full of
lamentations."""
175,12,78,"She took Raoul's protecting hands in hers and, with a long shiver,
continued:"
175,12,79,"""Yes, if I lived to be a hundred, I should always hear the superhuman
cry of grief and rage which he uttered when the terrible sight appeared
before my eyes ...  Raoul, you have seen death's heads, when they have
been dried and withered by the centuries, and, perhaps, if you were not
the victim of a nightmare, you saw HIS death's head at Perros.  And
then you saw Red Death stalking about at the last masked ball.  But all
those death's heads were motionless and their dumb horror was not
alive.  But imagine, if you can, Red Death's mask suddenly coming to
life in order to express, with the four black holes of its eyes, its
nose, and its mouth, the extreme anger, the mighty fury of a demon; AND
NOT A RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE SOCKETS, for, as I learned later, you can
not see his blazing eyes except in the dark."
175,12,80,"""I fell back against the wall and he came up to me, grinding his teeth,
and, as I fell upon my knees, he hissed mad, incoherent words and
curses at me.  Leaning over me, he cried, 'Look! You want to see!  See!
Feast your eyes, glut your soul on my cursed ugliness!  Look at Erik's
face!  Now you know the face of the voice!  You were not content to
hear me, eh?  You wanted to know what I looked like!  Oh, you women are
so inquisitive!  Well, are you satisfied?  I'm a very good - looking
fellow, eh? ... When a woman has seen me, as you have, she belongs to
me.  She loves me for ever.  I am a kind of Don Juan, you know!'  And,
drawing himself up to his full height, with his hand on his hip,
wagging the hideous thing that was his head on his shoulders, he
roared, 'Look at me!  I AM DON JUAN TRIUMPHANT!' And, when I turned
away my head and begged for mercy, he drew it to him, brutally,
twisting his dead fingers into my hair."""
175,12,81,"""Enough!  Enough!"" cried Raoul.  ""I will kill him.  In Heaven's name,
Christine, tell me where the dining - room on the lake is!  I must kill
him!"""
175,12,82,"""Oh, be quiet, Raoul, if you want to know!"""
175,12,83,"""Yes, I want to know how and why you went back; I must know! ...  But,
in any case, I will kill him!"""
175,12,84,"""Oh, Raoul, listen, listen! ... He dragged me by my hair and then ...
and then ... Oh, it is too horrible!"""
175,12,85,"""Well, what?  Out with it!"" exclaimed Raoul fiercely.  ""Out with it,
quick!"""
175,12,86,"""Then he hissed at me.  'Ah, I frighten you, do I? ... I dare say! ...
Perhaps you think that I have another mask, eh, and that this ... this
... my head is a mask?  Well,' he roared, 'tear it off as you did the
other!  Come!  Come along!  I insist!  Your hands!  Your hands!  Give
me your hands!'  And he seized my hands and dug them into his awful
face.  He tore his flesh with my nails, tore his terrible dead flesh
with my nails! ... 'Know,' he shouted, while his throat throbbed and
panted like a furnace, 'know that I am built up of death from head to
foot and that it is a corpse that loves you and adores you and will
never, never leave you! ... Look, I am not laughing now, I am crying,
crying for you, Christine, who have torn off my mask and who therefore
can never leave me again! ... As long as you thought me handsome, you
could have come back, I know you would have come back ... but, now that
you know my hideousness, you would run away for good... So I shall keep
you here! ... Why did you want to see me?  Oh, mad Christine, who
wanted to see me! ... When my own father never saw me and when my
mother, so as not to see me, made me a present of my first mask!'"
175,12,87,"""He had let go of me at last and was dragging himself about on the
floor, uttering terrible sobs. And then he crawled away like a snake,
went into his room, closed the door and left me alone to my
reflections.  Presently I heard the sound of the organ; and then I
began to understand Erik's contemptuous phrase when he spoke about
Opera music.  What I now heard was utterly different from what I had
heard up to then.  His Don Juan Triumphant (for I had not a doubt but
that he had rushed to his masterpiece to forget the horror of the
moment) seemed to me at first one long, awful, magnificent sob.  But,
little by little, it expressed every emotion, every suffering of which
mankind is capable.  It intoxicated me; and I opened the door that
separated us.  Erik rose, as I entered, BUT DARED NOT TURN IN MY
DIRECTION.  'Erik,' I cried, 'show me your face without fear!  I swear
that you are the most unhappy and sublime of men; and, if ever again I
shiver when I look at you, it will be because I am thinking of the
splendor of your genius!'  Then Erik turned round, for he believed me,
and I also had faith in myself.  He fell at my feet, with words of love
...  with words of love in his dead mouth ... and the music had ceased
...  He kissed the hem of my dress and did not see that I closed my
eyes."
175,12,88,"""What more can I tell you, dear?  You now know the tragedy.  It went on
for a fortnight -  - a fortnight during which I lied to him.  My lies were
as hideous as the monster who inspired them; but they were the price of
my liberty.  I burned his mask; and I managed so well that, even when
he was not singing, he tried to catch my eye, like a dog sitting by its
master.  He was my faithful slave and paid me endless little
attentions.  Gradually, I gave him such confidence that he ventured to
take me walking on the banks of the lake and to row me in the boat on
its leaden waters; toward the end of my captivity he let me out through
the gates that closed the underground passages in the Rue Scribe.  Here
a carriage awaited us and took us to the Bois.  The night when we met
you was nearly fatal to me, for he is terribly jealous of you and I had
to tell him that you were soon going away ...  Then, at last, after a
fortnight of that horrible captivity, during which I was filled with
pity, enthusiasm, despair and horror by turns, he believed me when I
said, 'I WILL COME BACK!'"""
175,12,89,"""And you went back, Christine,"" groaned Raoul."
175,12,90,"""Yes, dear, and I must tell you that it was not his frightful threats
when setting me free that helped me to keep my word, but the harrowing
sob which he gave on the threshold of the tomb.  ...  That sob attached
me to the unfortunate man more than I myself suspected when saying
good - by to him.  Poor Erik!  Poor Erik!"""
175,12,91,"""Christine,"" said Raoul, rising, ""you tell me that you love me; but you
had recovered your liberty hardly a few hours before you returned to
Erik!  Remember the masked ball!"""
175,12,92,"""Yes; and do you remember those hours which I passed with you, Raoul
... to the great danger of both of us?"""
175,12,93,"""I doubted your love for me, during those hours."""
175,12,94,"""Do you doubt it still, Raoul? ... Then know that each of my visits to
Erik increased my horror of him; for each of those visits, instead of
calming him, as I hoped, made him mad with love!  And I am so
frightened, so frightened! ..."""
175,12,95,"""You are frightened ... but do you love me?  If Erik were good - looking,
would you love me, Christine?"""
175,12,96,"She rose in her turn, put her two trembling arms round the young man's
neck and said:"
175,12,97,"""Oh, my betrothed of a day, if I did not love you, I would not give you
my lips!  Take them, for the first time and the last."""
175,12,98,"He kissed her lips; but the night that surrounded them was rent
asunder, they fled as at the approach of a storm and their eyes, filled
with dread of Erik, showed them, before they disappeared, high up above
them, an immense night - bird that stared at them with its blazing eyes
and seemed to cling to the string of Apollo's lyre."
175,13,1,"Raoul and Christine ran, eager to escape from the roof and the blazing
eyes that showed only in the dark; and they did not stop before they
came to the eighth floor on the way down."
175,13,2,"There was no performance at the Opera that night and the passages were
empty.  Suddenly, a queer - looking form stood before them and blocked
the road:"
175,13,3,"""No, not this way!"""
175,13,4,"And the form pointed to another passage by which they were to reach the
wings.  Raoul wanted to stop and ask for an explanation.  But the form,
which wore a sort of long frock - coat and a pointed cap, said:"
175,13,5,"""Quick!  Go away quickly!"""
175,13,6,"Christine was already dragging Raoul, compelling him to start running
again."
175,13,7,"""But who is he?  Who is that man?"" he asked."
175,13,8,"Christine replied:  ""It's the Persian."""
175,13,9,"""What's he doing here?"""
175,13,10,"""Nobody knows.  He is always in the Opera."""
175,13,11,"""You are making me run away, for the first time in my life.  If we
really saw Erik, what I ought to have done was to nail him to Apollo's
lyre, just as we nail the owls to the walls of our Breton farms; and
there would have been no more question of him."""
175,13,12,"""My dear Raoul, you would first have had to climb up to Apollo's lyre:
that is no easy matter."""
175,13,13,"""The blazing eyes were there!"""
175,13,14,"""Oh, you are getting like me now, seeing him everywhere!  What I took
for blazing eyes was probably a couple of stars shining through the
strings of the lyre."""
175,13,15,"And Christine went down another floor, with Raoul following her."
175,13,16,"""As you have quite made up your mind to go, Christine, I assure you it
would be better to go at once.  Why wait for to - morrow? He may have
heard us to - night."""
175,13,17,"""No, no, he is working, I tell you, at his Don Juan Triumphant and not
thinking of us."""
175,13,18,"""You're so sure of that you keep on looking behind you!"""
175,13,19,"""Come to my dressing - room."""
175,13,20,"""Hadn't we better meet outside the Opera?"""
175,13,21,"""Never, till we go away for good!  It would bring us bad luck, if I did
not keep my word.  I promised him to see you only here."""
175,13,22,"""It's a good thing for me that he allowed you even that.  Do you know,""
said Raoul bitterly, ""that it was very plucky of you to let us play at
being engaged?"""
175,13,23,"""Why, my dear, he knows all about it!  He said, 'I trust you,
Christine.  M. de Chagny is in love with you and is going abroad.
Before he goes, I want him to be as happy as I am.'  Are people so
unhappy when they love?"""
175,13,24,"""Yes, Christine, when they love and are not sure of being loved."""
175,13,25,They came to Christine's dressing - room.
175,13,26,"""Why do you think that you are safer in this room than on the stage?""
asked Raoul.  ""You heard him through the walls here, therefore he can
certainly hear us."""
175,13,27,"""No. He gave me his word not to be behind the walls of my dressing - room
again and I believe Erik's word.  This room and my bedroom on the lake
are for me, exclusively, and not to be approached by him."""
175,13,28,"""How can you have gone from this room into that dark passage,
Christine?  Suppose we try to repeat your movements; shall we?"""
175,13,29,"""It is dangerous, dear, for the glass might carry me off again; and,
instead of running away, I should be obliged to go to the end of the
secret passage to the lake and there call Erik."""
175,13,30,"""Would he hear you?"""
175,13,31,"""Erik will hear me wherever I call him.  He told me so.  He is a very
curious genius.  You must not think, Raoul, that he is simply a man who
amuses himself by living underground.  He does things that no other man
could do; he knows things which nobody in the world knows."""
175,13,32,"""Take care, Christine, you are making a ghost of him again!"""
175,13,33,"""No, he is not a ghost; he is a man of Heaven and earth, that is all."""
175,13,34,"""A man of Heaven and earth ... that is all! ... A nice way to speak of
him! ... And are you still resolved to run away from him?"""
175,13,35,"""Yes, to - morrow."""
175,13,36,"""To - morrow, you will have no resolve left!"""
175,13,37,"""Then, Raoul, you must run away with me in spite of myself; is that
understood?"""
175,13,38,"""I shall be here at twelve to - morrow night; I shall keep my promise,
whatever happens.  You say that, after listening to the performance, he
is to wait for you in the dining - room on the lake?"""
175,13,39,"""Yes."""
175,13,40,"""And how are you to reach him, if you don't know how to go out by the
glass?"""
175,13,41,"""Why, by going straight to the edge of the lake."""
175,13,42,"Christine opened a box, took out an enormous key and showed it to Raoul."
175,13,43,"""What's that?"" he asked."
175,13,44,"""The key of the gate to the underground passage in the Rue Scribe."""
175,13,45,"""I understand, Christine.  It leads straight to the lake.  Give it to
me, Christine, will you?"""
175,13,46,"""Never!"" she said.  ""That would be treacherous!"""
175,13,47,"Suddenly Christine changed color.  A mortal pallor overspread her
features."
175,13,48,"""Oh heavens!"" she cried.  ""Erik!  Erik!  Have pity on me!"""
175,13,49,"""Hold your tongue!"" said Raoul.  ""You told me he could hear you!"""
175,13,50,"But the singer's attitude became more and more inexplicable.  She wrung
her fingers, repeating, with a distraught air:"
175,13,51,"""Oh, Heaven!  Oh, Heaven!"""
175,13,52,"""But what is it?  What is it?""  Raoul implored."
175,13,53,"""The ring ... the gold ring he gave me."""
175,13,54,"""Oh, so Erik gave you that ring!"""
175,13,55,"""You know he did, Raoul!  But what you don't know is that, when he gave
it to me, he said, 'I give you back your liberty, Christine, on
condition that this ring is always on your finger.  As long as you keep
it, you will be protected against all danger and Erik will remain your
friend.  But woe to you if you ever part with it, for Erik will have
his revenge!' ... My dear, my dear, the ring is gone! ... Woe to us
both!"""
175,13,56,"They both looked for the ring, but could not find it.  Christine
refused to be pacified."
175,13,57,"""It was while I gave you that kiss, up above, under Apollo's lyre,"" she
said.  ""The ring must have slipped from my finger and dropped into the
street!  We can never find it.  And what misfortunes are in store for
us now!  Oh, to run away!"""
175,13,58,"""Let us run away at once,"" Raoul insisted, once more."
175,13,59,"She hesitated.  He thought that she was going to say yes...  Then her
bright pupils became dimmed and she said:"
175,13,60,"""No!  To - morrow!"""
175,13,61,"And she left him hurriedly, still wringing and rubbing her fingers, as
though she hoped to bring the ring back like that."
175,13,62,"Raoul went home, greatly perturbed at all that he had heard."
175,13,63,[Illustration: They Sat Like that for a Moment in Silence]
175,13,64,"""If I don't save her from the hands of that humbug,"" he said, aloud, as
he went to bed, ""she is lost.  But I shall save her."""
175,13,65,"He put out his lamp and felt a need to insult Erik in the dark.  Thrice
over, he shouted:"
175,13,66,"""Humbug! ... Humbug! ... Humbug!"""
175,13,67,"But, suddenly, he raised himself on his elbow.  A cold sweat poured
from his temples.  Two eyes, like blazing coals, had appeared at the
foot of his bed.  They stared at him fixedly, terribly, in the darkness
of the night."
175,13,68,"Raoul was no coward; and yet he trembled.  He put out a groping,
hesitating hand toward the table by his bedside.  He found the matches
and lit his candle.  The eyes disappeared."
175,13,69,"Still uneasy in his mind, he thought to himself:"
175,13,70,"""She told me that HIS eyes only showed in the dark.  His eyes have
disappeared in the light, but HE may be there still."""
175,13,71,"And he rose, hunted about, went round the room.  He looked under his
bed, like a child.  Then he thought himself absurd, got into bed again
and blew out the candle.  The eyes reappeared."
175,13,72,"He sat up and stared back at them with all the courage he possessed.
Then he cried:"
175,13,73,"""Is that you, Erik?  Man, genius, or ghost, is it you?"""
175,13,74,"He reflected:  ""If it's he, he's on the balcony!"""
175,13,75,"Then he ran to the chest of drawers and groped for his revolver.  He
opened the balcony window, looked out, saw nothing and closed the
window again.  He went back to bed, shivering, for the night was cold,
and put the revolver on the table within his reach."
175,13,76,"The eyes were still there, at the foot of the bed.  Were they between
the bed and the window - pane or behind the pane, that is to say, on the
balcony?  That was what Raoul wanted to know.  He also wanted to know
if those eyes belonged to a human being... He wanted to know
everything.  Then, patiently, calmly, he seized his revolver and took
aim.  He aimed a little above the two eyes.  Surely, if they were eyes
and if above those two eyes there was a forehead and if Raoul was not
too clumsy ..."
175,13,77,"The shot made a terrible din amid the silence of the slumbering house.
And, while footsteps came hurrying along the passages, Raoul sat up
with outstretched arm, ready to fire again, if need be."
175,13,78,"This time, the two eyes had disappeared."
175,13,79,"Servants appeared, carrying lights; Count Philippe, terribly anxious:"
175,13,80,"""What is it?"""
175,13,81,"""I think I have been dreaming,"" replied the young man.  ""I fired at two
stars that kept me from sleeping."""
175,13,82,"""You're raving!  Are you ill?  For God's sake, tell me, Raoul: what
happened?"""
175,13,83,And the count seized hold of the revolver.
175,13,84,"""No, no, I'm not raving...  Besides, we shall soon see ..."""
175,13,85,"He got out of bed, put on a dressing - gown and slippers, took a light
from the hands of a servant and, opening the window, stepped out on the
balcony."
175,13,86,"The count saw that the window had been pierced by a bullet at a man's
height.  Raoul was leaning over the balcony with his candle: ""Aha!"" he
said.  ""Blood! ... Blood! ... Here, there, more blood!  ...  That's a
good thing!  A ghost who bleeds is less dangerous!"" he grinned."
175,13,87,"""Raoul!  Raoul!  Raoul!"""
175,13,88,"The count was shaking him as though he were trying to waken a
sleep - walker."
175,13,89,"""But, my dear brother, I'm not asleep!""  Raoul protested impatiently.
""You can see the blood for yourself.  I thought I had been dreaming and
firing at two stars.  It was Erik's eyes ... and here is his blood! ...
After all, perhaps I was wrong to shoot; and Christine is quite capable
of never forgiving me ...  All this would not have happened if I had
drawn the curtains before going to bed."""
175,13,90,"""Raoul, have you suddenly gone mad?  Wake up!"""
175,13,91,"""What, still?  You would do better to help me find Erik ... for, after
all, a ghost who bleeds can always be found."""
175,13,92,The count's valet said:
175,13,93,"""That is so, sir; there is blood on the balcony."""
175,13,94,"The other man - servant brought a lamp, by the light of which they
examined the balcony carefully.  The marks of blood followed the rail
till they reached a gutter - spout; then they went up the gutter - spout."
175,13,95,"""My dear fellow,"" said Count Philippe, ""you have fired at a cat."""
175,13,96,"""The misfortune is,"" said Raoul, with a grin, ""that it's quite
possible.  With Erik, you never know.  Is it Erik?  Is it the cat?  Is
it the ghost?  No, with Erik, you can't tell!"""
175,13,97,"Raoul went on making this strange sort of remarks which corresponded so
intimately and logically with the preoccupation of his brain and which,
at the same time, tended to persuade many people that his mind was
unhinged.  The count himself was seized with this idea; and, later, the
examining magistrate, on receiving the report of the commissary of
police, came to the same conclusion."
175,13,98,"""Who is Erik?"" asked the count, pressing his brother's hand."
175,13,99,"""He is my rival.  And, if he's not dead, it's a pity."""
175,13,100,"He dismissed the servants with a wave of the hand and the two Chagnys
were left alone.  But the men were not out of earshot before the
count's valet heard Raoul say, distinctly and emphatically:"
175,13,101,"""I shall carry off Christine Daae to - night."""
175,13,102,"This phrase was afterward repeated to M. Faure, the
examining - magistrate.  But no one ever knew exactly what passed between
the two brothers at this interview.  The servants declared that this
was not their first quarrel.  Their voices penetrated the wall; and it
was always an actress called Christine Daae that was in question."
175,13,103,"At breakfast -  - the early morning breakfast, which the count took in his
study -  - Philippe sent for his brother.  Raoul arrived silent and gloomy.
The scene was a very short one.  Philippe handed his brother a copy of
the Epoque and said:"
175,13,104,"""Read that!"""
175,13,105,The viscount read:
175,13,106,"""The latest news in the Faubourg is that there is a promise of marriage
between Mlle. Christine Daae, the opera - singer, and M. le Vicomte Raoul
de Chagny.  If the gossips are to be credited, Count Philippe has sworn
that, for the first time on record, the Chagnys shall not keep their
promise.  But, as love is all - powerful, at the Opera as -  - and even more
than -  - elsewhere, we wonder how Count Philippe intends to prevent the
viscount, his brother, from leading the new Margarita to the altar.
The two brothers are said to adore each other; but the count is
curiously mistaken if he imagines that brotherly love will triumph over
love pure and simple."""
175,13,107,"""You see, Raoul,"" said the count, ""you are making us ridiculous!  That
little girl has turned your head with her ghost - stories."""
175,13,108,"The viscount had evidently repeated Christine's narrative to his
brother, during the night.  All that he now said was:"
175,13,109,"""Good - by, Philippe."""
175,13,110,"""Have you quite made up your mind?  You are going to - night? With her?"""
175,13,111,No reply.
175,13,112,"""Surely you will not do anything so foolish?  I SHALL know how to
prevent you!"""
175,13,113,"""Good - by, Philippe,"" said the viscount again and left the room."
175,13,114,"This scene was described to the examining - magistrate by the count
himself, who did not see Raoul again until that evening, at the Opera,
a few minutes before Christine's disappearance."
175,13,115,"Raoul, in fact, devoted the whole day to his preparations for the
flight.  The horses, the carriage, the coachman, the provisions, the
luggage, the money required for the journey, the road to be taken (he
had resolved not to go by train, so as to throw the ghost off the
scent): all this had to be settled and provided for; and it occupied
him until nine o'clock at night."
175,13,116,"At nine o'clock, a sort of traveling - barouche with the curtains of its
windows close - down, took its place in the rank on the Rotunda side.  It
was drawn by two powerful horses driven by a coachman whose face was
almost concealed in the long folds of a muffler.  In front of this
traveling - carriage were three broughams, belonging respectively to
Carlotta, who had suddenly returned to Paris, to Sorelli and, at the
head of the rank, to Comte Philippe de Chagny.  No one left the
barouche.  The coachman remained on his box, and the three other
coachmen remained on theirs."
175,13,117,"A shadow in a long black cloak and a soft black felt hat passed along
the pavement between the Rotunda and the carriages, examined the
barouche carefully, went up to the horses and the coachman and then
moved away without saying a word, The magistrate afterward believed
that this shadow was that of the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny; but I do not
agree, seeing that that evening, as every evening, the Vicomte de
Chagny was wearing a tall hat, which hat, besides, was subsequently
found.  I am more inclined to think that the shadow was that of the
ghost, who knew all about the whole affair, as the reader will soon
perceive."
175,13,118,"They were giving FAUST, as it happened, before a splendid house.  The
Faubourg was magnificently represented; and the paragraph in that
morning's EPOQUE had already produced its effect, for all eyes were
turned to the box in which Count Philippe sat alone, apparently in a
very indifferent and careless frame of mind.  The feminine element in
the brilliant audience seemed curiously puzzled; and the viscount's
absence gave rise to any amount of whispering behind the fans.
Christine Daae met with a rather cold reception.  That special audience
could not forgive her for aiming so high."
175,13,119,"The singer noticed this unfavorable attitude of a portion of the house
and was confused by it."
175,13,120,"The regular frequenters of the Opera, who pretended to know the truth
about the viscount's love - story, exchanged significant smiles at
certain passages in Margarita's part; and they made a show of turning
and looking at Philippe de Chagny's box when Christine sang:"
175,13,121,"""I wish I could but know who was he
That addressed me,
If he was noble, or, at least, what his name is."""
175,13,122,"The count sat with his chin on his hand and seemed to pay no attention
to these manifestations.  He kept his eyes fixed on the stage; but his
thoughts appeared to be far away."
175,13,123,"Christine lost her self - assurance more and more.  She trembled.  She
felt on the verge of a breakdown ...  Carolus Fonta wondered if she was
ill, if she could keep the stage until the end of the Garden Act.  In
the front of the house, people remembered the catastrophe that had
befallen Carlotta at the end of that act and the historic ""co - ack""
which had momentarily interrupted her career in Paris."
175,13,124,"Just then, Carlotta made her entrance in a box facing the stage, a
sensational entrance.  Poor Christine raised her eyes upon this fresh
subject of excitement.  She recognized her rival.  She thought she saw
a sneer on her lips.  That saved her.  She forgot everything, in order
to triumph once more."
175,13,125,"From that moment the prima donna sang with all her heart and soul.  She
tried to surpass all that she had done till then; and she succeeded.
In the last act when she began the invocation to the angels, she made
all the members of the audience feel as though they too had wings."
175,13,126,"In the center of the amphitheater a man stood up and remained standing,
facing the singer.  It was Raoul."
175,13,127,"""Holy angel, in Heaven blessed ..."""
175,13,128,"And Christine, her arms outstretched, her throat filled with music, the
glory of her hair falling over her bare shoulders, uttered the divine
cry:"
175,13,129,"""My spirit longs with thee to rest!"""
175,13,130,"It was at that moment that the stage was suddenly plunged in darkness.
It happened so quickly that the spectators hardly had time to utter a
sound of stupefaction, for the gas at once lit up the stage again.  But
Christine Daae was no longer there!"
175,13,131,"What had become of her?  What was that miracle?  All exchanged glances
without understanding, and the excitement at once reached its height.
Nor was the tension any less great on the stage itself.  Men rushed
from the wings to the spot where Christine had been singing that very
instant.  The performance was interrupted amid the greatest disorder."
175,13,132,"Where had Christine gone?  What witchcraft had snatched her, away
before the eyes of thousands of enthusiastic onlookers and from the
arms of Carolus Fonta himself?  It was as though the angels had really
carried her up ""to rest."""
175,13,133,"Raoul, still standing up in the amphitheater, had uttered a cry.  Count
Philippe had sprung to his feet in his box.  People looked at the
stage, at the count, at Raoul, and wondered if this curious event was
connected in any way with the paragraph in that morning's paper.  But
Raoul hurriedly left his seat, the count disappeared from his box and,
while the curtain was lowered, the subscribers rushed to the door that
led behind the scenes.  The rest of the audience waited amid an
indescribable hubbub.  Every one spoke at once.  Every one tried to
suggest an explanation of the extraordinary incident."
175,13,134,"At last, the curtain rose slowly and Carolus Fonta stepped to the
conductor's desk and, in a sad and serious voice, said:"
175,13,135,"""Ladies and gentlemen, an unprecedented event has taken place and
thrown us into a state of the greatest alarm.  Our sister - artist,
Christine Daae, has disappeared before our eyes and nobody can tell us
how!"""
175,14,1,"Behind the curtain, there was an indescribable crowd.  Artists,
scene - shifters, dancers, supers, choristers, subscribers were all
asking questions, shouting and hustling one another."
175,14,2,"""What became of her?"""
175,14,3,"""She's run away."""
175,14,4,"""With the Vicomte de Chagny, of course!"""
175,14,5,"""No, with the count!"""
175,14,6,"""Ah, here's Carlotta!  Carlotta did the trick!"""
175,14,7,"""No, it was the ghost!""  And a few laughed, especially as a careful
examination of the trap - doors and boards had put the idea of an
accident out of the question."
175,14,8,"Amid this noisy throng, three men stood talking in a low voice and with
despairing gestures.  They were Gabriel, the chorus - master; Mercier,
the acting - manager; and Remy, the secretary.  They retired to a corner
of the lobby by which the stage communicates with the wide passage
leading to the foyer of the ballet.  Here they stood and argued behind
some enormous ""properties."""
175,14,9,"""I knocked at the door,"" said Remy.  ""They did not answer.  Perhaps
they are not in the office.  In any case, it's impossible to find out,
for they took the keys with them."""
175,14,10,"""They"" were obviously the managers, who had given orders, during the
last entr'acte, that they were not to be disturbed on any pretext
whatever.  They were not in to anybody."
175,14,11,"""All the same,"" exclaimed Gabriel, ""a singer isn't run away with, from
the middle of the stage, every day!"""
175,14,12,"""Did you shout that to them?"" asked Mercier, impatiently."
175,14,13,"""I'll go back again,"" said Remy, and disappeared at a run."
175,14,14,Thereupon the stage - manager arrived.
175,14,15,"""Well, M. Mercier, are you coming?  What are you two doing here?
You're wanted, Mr. Acting - Manager."""
175,14,16,"""I refuse to know or to do anything before the commissary arrives,""
declared Mercier.  ""I have sent for Mifroid.  We shall see when he
comes!"""
175,14,17,"""And I tell you that you ought to go down to the organ at once."""
175,14,18,"""Not before the commissary comes."""
175,14,19,"""I've been down to the organ myself already."""
175,14,20,"""Ah!  And what did you see?"""
175,14,21,"""Well, I saw nobody!  Do you hear -  - nobody!"""
175,14,22,"""What do you want me to do down there for{sic}?"""
175,14,23,"""You're right!"" said the stage - manager, frantically pushing his hands
through his rebellious hair.  ""You're right!  But there might be some
one at the organ who could tell us how the stage came to be suddenly
darkened.  Now Mauclair is nowhere to be found.  Do you understand
that?"""
175,14,24,"Mauclair was the gas - man, who dispensed day and night at will on the
stage of the Opera."
175,14,25,"""Mauclair is not to be found!"" repeated Mercier, taken aback.  ""Well,
what about his assistants?"""
175,14,26,"""There's no Mauclair and no assistants!  No one at the lights, I tell
you!  You can imagine,"" roared the stage - manager, ""that that little
girl must have been carried off by somebody else:  she didn't run away
by herself!  It was a calculated stroke and we have to find out about
it ...  And what are the managers doing all this time?  ...  I gave
orders that no one was to go down to the lights and I posted a fireman
in front of the gas - man's box beside the organ.  Wasn't that right?"""
175,14,27,"""Yes, yes, quite right, quite right.  And now let's wait for the
commissary."""
175,14,28,"The stage - manager walked away, shrugging his shoulders, fuming,
muttering insults at those milksops who remained quietly squatting in a
corner while the whole theater was topsyturvy{sic}."
175,14,29,"Gabriel and Mercier were not so quiet as all that.  Only they had
received an order that paralyzed them.  The managers were not to be
disturbed on any account.  Remy had violated that order and met with no
success."
175,14,30,"At that moment he returned from his new expedition, wearing a curiously
startled air."
175,14,31,"""Well, have you seen them?"" asked Mercier."
175,14,32,"""Moncharmin opened the door at last.  His eyes were starting out of his
head.  I thought he meant to strike me.  I could not get a word in; and
what do you think he shouted at me?  'Have you a safety - pin?' 'No!'
'Well, then, clear out!'  I tried to tell him that an unheard - of thing
had happened on the stage, but he roared, 'A safety - pin! Give me a
safety - pin at once!'  A boy heard him -  - he was bellowing like a
bull -  - ran up with a safety - pin and gave it to him; whereupon Moncharmin
slammed the door in my face, and there you are!"""
175,14,33,"""And couldn't you have said, 'Christine Daae.'"""
175,14,34,"""I should like to have seen you in my place.  He was foaming at the
mouth.  He thought of nothing but his safety - pin. I believe, if they
hadn't brought him one on the spot, he would have fallen down in a fit!
... Oh, all this isn't natural; and our managers are going mad! ...
Besides, it can't go on like this!  I'm not used to being treated in
that fashion!"""
175,14,35,Suddenly Gabriel whispered:
175,14,36,"""It's another trick of O. G.'s."""
175,14,37,"Rimy gave a grin, Mercier a sigh and seemed about to speak ... but,
meeting Gabriel's eye, said nothing."
175,14,38,"However, Mercier felt his responsibility increased as the minutes
passed without the managers' appearing; and, at last, he could stand it
no longer."
175,14,39,"""Look here, I'll go and hunt them out myself!"""
175,14,40,"Gabriel, turning very gloomy and serious, stopped him."
175,14,41,"""Be careful what you're doing, Mercier!  If they're staying in their
office, it's probably because they have to!  O. G. has more than one
trick in his bag!"""
175,14,42,But Mercier shook his head.
175,14,43,"""That's their lookout!  I'm going!  If people had listened to me, the
police would have known everything long ago!"""
175,14,44,And he went.
175,14,45,"""What's everything?"" asked Remy.  ""What was there to tell the police?
Why don't you answer, Gabriel? ... Ah, so you know something!  Well,
you would do better to tell me, too, if you don't want me to shout out
that you are all going mad! ... Yes, that's what you are:  mad!"""
175,14,46,"Gabriel put on a stupid look and pretended not to understand the
private secretary's unseemly outburst."
175,14,47,"""What 'something' am I supposed to know?"" he said.  ""I don't know what
you mean."""
175,14,48,Remy began to lose his temper.
175,14,49,"""This evening, Richard and Moncharmin were behaving like lunatics,
here, between the acts."""
175,14,50,"""I never noticed it,"" growled Gabriel, very much annoyed."
175,14,51,"""Then you're the only one! ... Do you think that I didn't see them? ...
And that M. Parabise, the manager of the Credit Central, noticed
nothing? ... And that M. de La Borderie, the ambassador, has no eyes to
see with? ... Why, all the subscribers were pointing at our managers!"""
175,14,52,"""But what were our managers doing?"" asked Gabriel, putting on his most
innocent air."
175,14,53,"""What were they doing?  You know better than any one what they were
doing! ... You were there! ... And you were watching them, you and
Mercier! ... And you were the only two who didn't laugh."""
175,14,54,"""I don't understand!"""
175,14,55,"Gabriel raised his arms and dropped them to his sides again, which
gesture was meant to convey that the question did not interest him in
the least.  Remy continued:"
175,14,56,"""What is the sense of this new mania of theirs?  WHY WON'T THEY HAVE
ANY ONE COME NEAR THEM NOW?"""
175,14,57,"""What?  WON'T THEY HAVE ANY ONE COME NEAR THEM?"""
175,14,58,"""AND THEY WON'T LET ANY ONE TOUCH THEM!"""
175,14,59,"""Really?  Have you noticed THAT THEY WON'T LET ANY ONE TOUCH THEM?
That is certainly odd!"""
175,14,60,"""Oh, so you admit it!  And high time, too!  And THEN, THEY WALK
BACKWARD!"""
175,14,61,"""BACKWARD!  You have seen our managers WALK BACKWARD?  Why, I thought
that only crabs walked backward!"""
175,14,62,"""Don't laugh, Gabriel; don't laugh!"""
175,14,63,"""I'm not laughing,"" protested Gabriel, looking as solemn as a judge."
175,14,64,"""Perhaps you can tell me this, Gabriel, as you're an intimate friend of
the management:  When I went up to M. Richard, outside the foyer,
during the Garden interval, with my hand out before me, why did M.
Moncharmin hurriedly whisper to me, 'Go away!  Go away!  Whatever you
do, don't touch M. le Directeur!'  Am I supposed to have an infectious
disease?"""
175,14,65,"""It's incredible!"""
175,14,66,"""And, a little later, when M. de La Borderie went up to M. Richard,
didn't you see M. Moncharmin fling himself between them and hear him
exclaim, 'M. l'Ambassadeur I entreat you not to touch M. le Directeur'?"""
175,14,67,"""It's terrible! ... And what was Richard doing meanwhile?"""
175,14,68,"""What was he doing?  Why, you saw him!  He turned about, BOWED IN FRONT
OF HIM, THOUGH THERE WAS NOBODY IN FRONT OF HIM, AND WITHDREW BACKWARD."""
175,14,69,"""BACKWARD?"""
175,14,70,"""And Moncharmin, behind Richard, also turned about; that is, he
described a semicircle behind Richard and also WALKED BACKWARD! ... And
they went LIKE THAT to the staircase leading to the managers' office:
BACKWARD, BACKWARD, BACKWARD!  ...  Well, if they are not mad, will you
explain what it means?"""
175,14,71,"""Perhaps they were practising a figure in the ballet,"" suggested
Gabriel, without much conviction in his voice."
175,14,72,"The secretary was furious at this wretched joke, made at so dramatic a
moment.  He knit his brows and contracted his lips.  Then he put his
mouth to Gabriel's ear:"
175,14,73,"""Don't be so sly, Gabriel.  There are things going on for which you and
Mercier are partly responsible."""
175,14,74,"""What do you mean?"" asked Gabriel."
175,14,75,"""Christine Daae is not the only one who suddenly disappeared to - night."""
175,14,76,"""Oh, nonsense!"""
175,14,77,"""There's no nonsense about it.  Perhaps you can tell me why, when
Mother Giry came down to the foyer just now, Mercier took her by the
hand and hurried her away with him?"""
175,14,78,"""Really?"" said Gabriel, ""I never saw it."""
175,14,79,"""You did see it, Gabriel, for you went with Mercier and Mother Giry to
Mercier's office.  Since then, you and Mercier have been seen, but no
one has seen Mother Giry."""
175,14,80,"""Do you think we've eaten her?"""
175,14,81,"""No, but you've locked her up in the office; and any one passing the
office can hear her yelling, 'Oh, the scoundrels!  Oh, the scoundrels!'"""
175,14,82,"At this point of this singular conversation, Mercier arrived, all out
of breath."
175,14,83,"""There!"" he said, in a gloomy voice.  ""It's worse than ever! ...  I
shouted, 'It's a serious matter!  Open the door!  It's I, Mercier.' I
heard footsteps.  The door opened and Moncharmin appeared.  He was very
pale.  He said, 'What do you want?'  I answered, 'Some one has run away
with Christine Daae.'  What do you think he said?  'And a good job,
too!'  And he shut the door, after putting this in my hand."""
175,14,84,Mercier opened his hand; Remy and Gabriel looked.
175,14,85,"""The safety - pin!"" cried Remy."
175,14,86,"""Strange!  Strange!"" muttered Gabriel, who could not help shivering."
175,14,87,Suddenly a voice made them all three turn round.
175,14,88,"""I beg your pardon, gentlemen.  Could you tell me where Christine Daae
is?"""
175,14,89,"In spite of the seriousness of the circumstances, the absurdity of the
question would have made them roar with laughter, if they had not
caught sight of a face so sorrow - stricken that they were at once seized
with pity.  It was the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny."
175,15,1,"Raoul's first thought, after Christine Daae's fantastic disappearance,
was to accuse Erik.  He no longer doubted the almost supernatural
powers of the Angel of Music, in this domain of the Opera in which he
had set up his empire.  And Raoul rushed on the stage, in a mad fit of
love and despair."
175,15,2,"""Christine!  Christine!"" he moaned, calling to her as he felt that she
must be calling to him from the depths of that dark pit to which the
monster had carried her.  ""Christine!  Christine!"""
175,15,3,"And he seemed to hear the girl's screams through the frail boards that
separated him from her.  He bent forward, he listened, ... he wandered
over the stage like a madman.  Ah, to descend, to descend into that pit
of darkness every entrance to which was closed to him, ... for the
stairs that led below the stage were forbidden to one and all that
night!"
175,15,4,"""Christine!  Christine! ..."""
175,15,5,"People pushed him aside, laughing.  They made fun of him.  They thought
the poor lover's brain was gone!"
175,15,6,"By what mad road, through what passages of mystery and darkness known
to him alone had Erik dragged that pure - souled child to the awful
haunt, with the Louis - Philippe room, opening out on the lake?"
175,15,7,"""Christine!  Christine! ... Why don't you answer? ... Are you alive?
..."""
175,15,8,"Hideous thoughts flashed through Raoul's congested brain.  Of course,
Erik must have discovered their secret, must have known that Christine
had played him false.  What a vengeance would be his!"
175,15,9,"And Raoul thought again of the yellow stars that had come, the night
before, and roamed over his balcony.  Why had he not put them out for
good?  There were some men's eyes that dilated in the darkness and
shone like stars or like cats' eyes.  Certainly Albinos, who seemed to
have rabbits' eyes by day, had cats' eyes at night: everybody knew
that! ... Yes, yes, he had undoubtedly fired at Erik.  Why had he not
killed him?  The monster had fled up the gutter - spout like a cat or a
convict who -  - everybody knew that also -  - would scale the very skies, with
the help of a gutter - spout ...  No doubt Erik was at that time
contemplating some decisive step against Raoul, but he had been wounded
and had escaped to turn against poor Christine instead."
175,15,10,"Such were the cruel thoughts that haunted Raoul as he ran to the
singer's dressing - room."
175,15,11,"""Christine!  Christine!"""
175,15,12,"Bitter tears scorched the boy's eyelids as he saw scattered over the
furniture the clothes which his beautiful bride was to have worn at the
hour of their flight.  Oh, why had she refused to leave earlier?"
175,15,13,"Why had she toyed with the threatening catastrophe?  Why toyed with the
monster's heart?  Why, in a final access of pity, had she insisted on
flinging, as a last sop to that demon's soul, her divine song:"
175,15,14,"""Holy angel, in Heaven blessed,
My spirit longs with thee to rest!"""
175,15,15,"Raoul, his throat filled with sobs, oaths and insults, fumbled
awkwardly at the great mirror that had opened one night, before his
eyes, to let Christine pass to the murky dwelling below.  He pushed,
pressed, groped about, but the glass apparently obeyed no one but Erik
...  Perhaps actions were not enough with a glass of the kind?  Perhaps
he was expected to utter certain words?  When he was a little boy, he
had heard that there were things that obeyed the spoken word!"
175,15,16,"Suddenly, Raoul remembered something about a gate opening into the Rue
Scribe, an underground passage running straight to the Rue Scribe from
the lake ...  Yes, Christine had told him about that...  And, when he
found that the key was no longer in the box, he nevertheless ran to the
Rue Scribe.  Outside, in the street, he passed his trembling hands over
the huge stones, felt for outlets ... met with iron bars ... were those
they? ... Or these? ...  Or could it be that air - hole? ... He plunged
his useless eyes through the bars ...  How dark it was in there! ... He
listened ...  All was silence! ... He went round the building ... and
came to bigger bars, immense gates! ... It was the entrance to the Cour
de l'Administration."
175,15,17,Raoul rushed into the doorkeeper's lodge.
175,15,18,"""I beg your pardon, madame, could you tell me where to find a gate or
door, made of bars, iron bars, opening into the Rue Scribe ...  and
leading to the lake? ... You know the lake I mean? ... Yes, the
underground lake ... under the Opera."""
175,15,19,"""Yes, sir, I know there is a lake under the Opera, but I don't know
which door leads to it.  I have never been there!"""
175,15,20,"""And the Rue Scribe, madame, the Rue Scribe?  Have you never been to
the Rue Scribe?"""
175,15,21,"The woman laughed, screamed with laughter!  Raoul darted away, roaring
with anger, ran up - stairs, four stairs at a time, down - stairs, rushed
through the whole of the business side of the opera - house, found
himself once more in the light of the stage."
175,15,22,"He stopped, with his heart thumping in his chest:  suppose Christine
Daae had been found?  He saw a group of men and asked:"
175,15,23,"""I beg your pardon, gentlemen.  Could you tell me where Christine Daae
is?"""
175,15,24,And somebody laughed.
175,15,25,"At the same moment the stage buzzed with a new sound and, amid a crowd
of men in evening - dress, all talking and gesticulating together,
appeared a man who seemed very calm and displayed a pleasant face, all
pink and chubby - cheeked, crowned with curly hair and lit up by a pair
of wonderfully serene blue eyes.  Mercier, the acting - manager, called
the Vicomte de Chagny's attention to him and said:"
175,15,26,"""This is the gentleman to whom you should put your question, monsieur.
Let me introduce Mifroid, the commissary of police."""
175,15,27,"""Ah, M. le Vicomte de Chagny!  Delighted to meet you, monsieur,"" said
the commissary.  ""Would you mind coming with me? ... And now where are
the managers? ... Where are the managers?"""
175,15,28,"Mercier did not answer, and Remy, the secretary, volunteered the
information that the managers were locked up in their office and that
they knew nothing as yet of what had happened."
175,15,29,"""You don't mean to say so!  Let us go up to the office!"""
175,15,30,"And M. Mifroid, followed by an ever - increasing crowd, turned toward the
business side of the building.  Mercier took advantage of the confusion
to slip a key into Gabriel's hand:"
175,15,31,"""This is all going very badly,"" he whispered.  ""You had better let
Mother Giry out."""
175,15,32,And Gabriel moved away.
175,15,33,"They soon came to the managers' door.  Mercier stormed in vain: the
door remained closed."
175,15,34,"""Open in the name of the law!"" commanded M. Mifroid, in a loud and
rather anxious voice."
175,15,35,"At last the door was opened.  All rushed in to the office, on the
commissary's heels."
175,15,36,"Raoul was the last to enter.  As he was about to follow the rest into
the room, a hand was laid on his shoulder and he heard these words
spoken in his ear:"
175,15,37,"""ERIK'S SECRETS CONCERN NO ONE BUT HIMSELF!"""
175,15,38,"He turned around, with a stifled exclamation.  The hand that was laid
on his shoulder was now placed on the lips of a person with an ebony
skin, with eyes of jade and with an astrakhan cap on his head: the
Persian!  The stranger kept up the gesture that recommended discretion
and then, at the moment when the astonished viscount was about to ask
the reason of his mysterious intervention, bowed and disappeared."
175,16,0,Relations with the Opera Ghost
175,16,1,"Before following the commissary into the manager's office I must
describe certain extraordinary occurrences that took place in that
office which Remy and Mercier had vainly tried to enter and into which
MM. Richard and Moncharmin had locked themselves with an object which
the reader does not yet know, but which it is my duty, as an historian,
to reveal without further postponement."
175,16,2,"I have had occasion to say that the managers' mood had undergone a
disagreeable change for some time past and to convey the fact that this
change was due not only to the fall of the chandelier on the famous
night of the gala performance."
175,16,3,"The reader must know that the ghost had calmly been paid his first
twenty thousand francs.  Oh, there had been wailing and gnashing of
teeth, indeed!  And yet the thing had happened as simply as could be."
175,16,4,"One morning, the managers found on their table an envelope addressed to
""Monsieur O. G. (private)"" and accompanied by a note from O. G. himself:"
175,16,5,"The time has come to carry out the clause in the memorandum - book.
Please put twenty notes of a thousand francs each into this envelope,
seal it with your own seal and hand it to Mme. Giry, who will do what
is necessary."
175,16,6,"The managers did not hesitate; without wasting time in asking how these
confounded communications came to be delivered in an office which they
were careful to keep locked, they seized this opportunity of laying
hands, on the mysterious blackmailer.  And, after telling the whole
story, under the promise of secrecy, to Gabriel and Mercier, they put
the twenty thousand francs into the envelope and without asking for
explanations, handed it to Mme. Giry, who had been reinstated in her
functions.  The box - keeper displayed no astonishment.  I need hardly
say that she was well watched.  She went straight to the ghost's box
and placed the precious envelope on the little shelf attached to the
ledge.  The two managers, as well as Gabriel and Mercier, were hidden
in such a way that they did not lose sight of the envelope for a second
during the performance and even afterward, for, as the envelope had not
moved, those who watched it did not move either; and Mme. Giry went
away while the managers, Gabriel and Mercier were still there.  At
last, they became tired of waiting and opened the envelope, after
ascertaining that the seals had not been broken."
175,16,7,"At first sight, Richard and Moncharmin thought that the notes were
still there; but soon they perceived that they were not the same.  The
twenty real notes were gone and had been replaced by twenty notes, of
the ""Bank of St. Farce""![1]"
175,16,8,"The managers' rage and fright were unmistakable.  Moncharmin wanted to
send for the commissary of police, but Richard objected.  He no doubt
had a plan, for he said:"
175,16,9,"""Don't let us make ourselves ridiculous!  All Paris would laugh at us.
O. G. has won the first game:  we will win the second."""
175,16,10,He was thinking of the next month's allowance.
175,16,11,"Nevertheless, they had been so absolutely tricked that they were bound
to suffer a certain dejection.  And, upon my word, it was not difficult
to understand.  We must not forget that the managers had an idea at the
back of their minds, all the time, that this strange incident might be
an unpleasant practical joke on the part of their predecessors and that
it would not do to divulge it prematurely.  On the other hand,
Moncharmin was sometimes troubled with a suspicion of Richard himself,
who occasionally took fanciful whims into his head.  And so they were
content to await events, while keeping an eye on Mother Giry.  Richard
would not have her spoken to."
175,16,12,"""If she is a confederate,"" he said, ""the notes are gone long ago.  But,
in my opinion, she is merely an idiot."""
175,16,13,"""She's not the only idiot in this business,"" said Moncharmin pensively."
175,16,14,"""Well, who could have thought it?"" moaned Richard.  ""But don't be
afraid ... next time, I shall have taken my precautions."""
175,16,15,"The next time fell on the same day that beheld the disappearance of
Christine Daae.  In the morning, a note from the ghost reminded them
that the money was due.  It read:"
175,16,16,"Do just as you did last time.  It went very well.  Put the twenty
thousand in the envelope and hand it to our excellent Mme. Giry."
175,16,17,"And the note was accompanied by the usual envelope.  They had only to
insert the notes."
175,16,18,"This was done about half an hour before the curtain rose on the first
act of Faust.  Richard showed the envelope to Moncharmin.  Then he
counted the twenty thousand - franc notes in front of him and put the
notes into the envelope, but without closing it."
175,16,19,"""And now,"" he said, ""let's have Mother Giry in."""
175,16,20,"The old woman was sent for.  She entered with a sweeping courtesy.  She
still wore her black taffeta dress, the color of which was rapidly
turning to rust and lilac, to say nothing of the dingy bonnet.  She
seemed in a good temper.  She at once said:"
175,16,21,"""Good evening, gentlemen!  It's for the envelope, I suppose?"""
175,16,22,"""Yes, Mme. Giry,"" said Richard, most amiably.  ""For the envelope ...
and something else besides."""
175,16,23,"""At your service, M. Richard, at your service.  And what is the
something else, please?"""
175,16,24,"""First of all, Mme. Giry, I have a little question to put to you."""
175,16,25,"""By all means, M. Richard:  Mme. Giry is here to answer you."""
175,16,26,"""Are you still on good terms with the ghost?"""
175,16,27,"""Couldn't be better, sir; couldn't be better."""
175,16,28,"""Ah, we are delighted ...  Look here, Mme. Giry,"" said Richard, in the
tone of making an important confidence.  ""We may just as well tell you,
among ourselves ... you're no fool!"""
175,16,29,"""Why, sir,"" exclaimed the box - keeper, stopping the pleasant nodding of
the black feathers in her dingy bonnet, ""I assure you no one has ever
doubted that!"""
175,16,30,"""We are quite agreed and we shall soon understand one another.  The
story of the ghost is all humbug, isn't it? ... Well, still between
ourselves, ... it has lasted long enough."""
175,16,31,"Mme. Giry looked at the managers as though they were talking Chinese.
She walked up to Richard's table and asked, rather anxiously:"
175,16,32,"""What do you mean?  I don't understand."""
175,16,33,"""Oh, you, understand quite well.  In any case, you've got to
understand...  And, first of all, tell us his name."""
175,16,34,"""Whose name?"""
175,16,35,"""The name of the man whose accomplice you are, Mme. Giry!"""
175,16,36,"""I am the ghost's accomplice?  I? ... His accomplice in what, pray?"""
175,16,37,"""You do all he wants."""
175,16,38,"""Oh!  He's not very troublesome, you know."""
175,16,39,"""And does he still tip you?"""
175,16,40,"""I mustn't complain."""
175,16,41,"""How much does he give you for bringing him that envelope?"""
175,16,42,"""Ten francs."""
175,16,43,"""You poor thing!  That's not much, is it?"
175,16,44,"""Why?"""
175,16,45,"""I'll tell you that presently, Mme. Giry.  Just now we should like to
know for what extraordinary reason you have given yourself body and
soul, to this ghost ... Mme. Giry's friendship and devotion are not to
be bought for five francs or ten francs."""
175,16,46,"""That's true enough ...  And I can tell you the reason, sir.  There's
no disgrace about it...  on the contrary."""
175,16,47,"""We're quite sure of that, Mme. Giry!"""
175,16,48,"""Well, it's like this ... only the ghost doesn't like me to talk about
his business."""
175,16,49,"""Indeed?"" sneered Richard."
175,16,50,"""But this is a matter that concerns myself alone ...  Well, it was in
Box Five one evening, I found a letter addressed to myself, a sort of
note written in red ink.  I needn't read the letter to you sir; I know
it by heart, and I shall never forget it if I live to be a hundred!"""
175,16,51,"And Mme. Giry, drawing herself up, recited the letter with touching
eloquence:"
175,16,52,MADAM:
175,16,53,"1825.  Mlle. Menetrier, leader of the ballet, became Marquise de Cussy."
175,16,54,"1832.  Mlle. Marie Taglioni, a dancer, became Comtesse Gilbert des
Voisins."
175,16,55,"1846.  La Sota, a dancer, married a brother of the King of Spain."
175,16,56,"1847.  Lola Montes, a dancer, became the morganatic wife of King Louis
of Bavaria and was created Countess of Landsfeld."
175,16,57,"1848.  Mlle. Maria, a dancer, became Baronne d'Herneville."
175,16,58,"1870.  Theresa Hessier, a dancer, married Dom Fernando, brother to the
King of Portugal."
175,16,59,"Richard and Moncharmin listened to the old woman, who, as she proceeded
with the enumeration of these glorious nuptials, swelled out, took
courage and, at last, in a voice bursting with pride, flung out the
last sentence of the prophetic letter:"
175,16,60,"1885.  Meg Giry, Empress!"
175,16,61,"Exhausted by this supreme effort, the box - keeper fell into a chair,
saying:"
175,16,62,"""Gentlemen, the letter was signed, 'Opera Ghost.'  I had heard much of
the ghost, but only half believed in him.  From the day when he
declared that my little Meg, the flesh of my flesh, the fruit of my
womb, would be empress, I believed in him altogether."""
175,16,63,"And really it was not necessary to make a long study of Mme. Giry's
excited features to understand what could be got out of that fine
intellect with the two words ""ghost"" and ""empress."""
175,16,64,"But who pulled the strings of that extraordinary puppet?  That was the
question."
175,16,65,"""You have never seen him; he speaks to you and you believe all he
says?"" asked Moncharmin."
175,16,66,"""Yes.  To begin with, I owe it to him that my little Meg was promoted
to be the leader of a row.  I said to the ghost, 'If she is to be
empress in 1885, there is no time to lose; she must become a leader at
once.' He said, 'Look upon it as done.'  And he had only a word to say
to M. Poligny and the thing was done."""
175,16,67,"""So you see that M. Poligny saw him!"""
175,16,68,"""No, not any more than I did; but he heard him.  The ghost said a word
in his ear, you know, on the evening when he left Box Five, looking so
dreadfully pale."""
175,16,69,"Moncharmin heaved a sigh.  ""What a business!"" he groaned."
175,16,70,"""Ah!"" said Mme. Giry.  ""I always thought there were secrets between the
ghost and M. Poligny.  Anything that the ghost asked M. Poligny to do
M. Poligny did.  M. Poligny could refuse the ghost nothing."""
175,16,71,"""You hear, Richard:  Poligny could refuse the ghost nothing."""
175,16,72,"""Yes, yes, I hear!"" said Richard.  ""M. Poligny is a friend of the
ghost; and, as Mme. Giry is a friend of M. Poligny, there we are!  ...
But I don't care a hang about M. Poligny,"" he added roughly.  ""The only
person whose fate really interests me is Mme. Giry...  Mme. Giry, do
you know what is in this envelope?"""
175,16,73,"""Why, of course not,"" she said."
175,16,74,"""Well, look."""
175,16,75,"Mine.  Giry looked into the envelope with a lackluster eye, which soon
recovered its brilliancy."
175,16,76,"""Thousand - franc notes!"" she cried."
175,16,77,"""Yes, Mme. Giry, thousand - franc notes!  And you knew it!"""
175,16,78,"""I, sir?  I? ... I swear ..."""
175,16,79,"""Don't swear, Mme. Giry! ... And now I will tell you the second reason
why I sent for you.  Mme. Giry, I am going to have you arrested."""
175,16,80,"The two black feathers on the dingy bonnet, which usually affected the
attitude of two notes of interrogation, changed into two notes of
exclamation; as for the bonnet itself, it swayed in menace on the old
lady's tempestuous chignon.  Surprise, indignation, protest and dismay
were furthermore displayed by little Meg's mother in a sort of
extravagant movement of offended virtue, half bound, half slide, that
brought her right under the nose of M. Richard, who could not help
pushing back his chair."
175,16,81,"""HAVE ME ARRESTED!"""
175,16,82,"The mouth that spoke those words seemed to spit the three teeth that
were left to it into Richard's face."
175,16,83,"M. Richard behaved like a hero.  He retreated no farther.  His
threatening forefinger seemed already to be pointing out the keeper of
Box Five to the absent magistrates."
175,16,84,"""I am going to have you arrested, Mme. Giry, as a thief!"""
175,16,85,"""Say that again!"""
175,16,86,"And Mme. Giry caught Mr. Manager Richard a mighty box on the ear,
before Mr. Manager Moncharmin had time to intervene.  But it was not
the withered hand of the angry old beldame that fell on the managerial
ear, but the envelope itself, the cause of all the trouble, the magic
envelope that opened with the blow, scattering the bank - notes, which
escaped in a fantastic whirl of giant butterflies."
175,16,87,"The two managers gave a shout, and the same thought made them both go
on their knees, feverishly, picking up and hurriedly examining the
precious scraps of paper."
175,16,88,"""Are they still genuine, Moncharmin?"""
175,16,89,"""Are they still genuine, Richard?"""
175,16,90,"""Yes, they are still genuine!"""
175,16,91,"Above their heads, Mme. Giry's three teeth were clashing in a noisy
contest, full of hideous interjections.  But all that could be clearly
distinguished was this LEIT - MOTIF:"
175,16,92,"""I, a thief! ... I, a thief, I?"""
175,16,93,She choked with rage.  She shouted:
175,16,94,"""I never heard of such a thing!"""
175,16,95,"And, suddenly, she darted up to Richard again."
175,16,96,"""In any case,"" she yelped, ""you, M. Richard, ought to know better than
I where the twenty thousand francs went to!"""
175,16,97,"""I?"" asked Richard, astounded.  ""And how should I know?"""
175,16,98,"Moncharmin, looking severe and dissatisfied, at once insisted that the
good lady should explain herself."
175,16,99,"""What does this mean, Mme. Giry?"" he asked.  ""And why do you say that
M. Richard ought to know better than you where the twenty - thousand
francs went to?"""
175,16,100,"As for Richard, who felt himself turning red under Moncharmin's eyes,
he took Mme. Giry by the wrist and shook it violently.  In a voice
growling and rolling like thunder, he roared:"
175,16,101,"""Why should I know better than you where the twenty - thousand francs
went to?  Why?  Answer me!"""
175,16,102,"""Because they went into your pocket!"" gasped the old woman, looking at
him as if he were the devil incarnate."
175,16,103,"Richard would have rushed upon Mme. Giry, if Moncharmin had not stayed
his avenging hand and hastened to ask her, more gently:"
175,16,104,"""How can you suspect my partner, M. Richard, of putting twenty - thousand
francs in his pocket?"""
175,16,105,"""I never said that,"" declared Mme. Giry, ""seeing that it was myself who
put the twenty - thousand francs into M. Richard's pocket."" And she
added, under her voice, ""There!  It's out! ... And may the ghost
forgive me!"""
175,16,106,"Richard began bellowing anew, but Moncharmin authoritatively ordered
him to be silent."
175,16,107,"""Allow me!  Allow me!  Let the woman explain herself.  Let me question
her.""  And he added:  ""It is really astonishing that you should take up
such a tone! ... We are on the verge of clearing up the whole mystery.
And you're in a rage! ... You're wrong to behave like that...  I'm
enjoying myself immensely."""
175,16,108,"Mme. Giry, like the martyr that she was, raised her head, her face
beaming with faith in her own innocence."
175,16,109,"""You tell me there were twenty - thousand francs in the envelope which I
put into M. Richard's pocket; but I tell you again that I knew nothing
about it ...  Nor M. Richard either, for that matter!"""
175,16,110,"""Aha!"" said Richard, suddenly assuming a swaggering air which
Moncharmin did not like.  ""I knew nothing either!  You put
twenty - thousand francs in my pocket and I knew nothing either!  I am
very glad to hear it, Mme. Giry!"""
175,16,111,"""Yes,"" the terrible dame agreed, ""yes, it's true.  We neither of us
knew anything.  But you, you must have ended by finding out!"""
175,16,112,"Richard would certainly have swallowed Mme. Giry alive, if Moncharmin
had not been there!  But Moncharmin protected her.  He resumed his
questions:"
175,16,113,"""What sort of envelope did you put in M. Richard's pocket?  It was not
the one which we gave you, the one which you took to Box Five before
our eyes; and yet that was the one which contained the twenty - thousand
francs."""
175,16,114,"""I beg your pardon.  The envelope which M. le Directeur gave me was the
one which I slipped into M. le Directeur's pocket,"" explained Mme.
Giry.  ""The one which I took to the ghost's box was another envelope,
just like it, which the ghost gave me beforehand and which I hid up my
sleeve."""
175,16,115,"So saying, Mme. Giry took from her sleeve an envelope ready prepared
and similarly addressed to that containing the twenty - thousand francs.
The managers took it from her.  They examined it and saw that it was
fastened with seals stamped with their own managerial seal.  They
opened it.  It contained twenty Bank of St. Farce notes like those
which had so much astounded them the month before."
175,16,116,"""How simple!"" said Richard."
175,16,117,"""How simple!"" repeated Moncharmin.  And he continued with his eyes
fixed upon Mme. Giry, as though trying to hypnotize her."
175,16,118,"""So it was the ghost who gave you this envelope and told you to
substitute it for the one which we gave you?  And it was the ghost who
told you to put the other into M. Richard's pocket?"""
175,16,119,"""Yes, it was the ghost."""
175,16,120,"""Then would you mind giving us a specimen of your little talents?  Here
is the envelope.  Act as though we knew nothing."""
175,16,121,"""As you please, gentlemen."""
175,16,122,"Mme. Giry took the envelope with the twenty notes inside it and made
for the door.  She was on the point of going out when the two managers
rushed at her:"
175,16,123,"""Oh, no!  Oh, no!  We're not going to be 'done' a second time!  Once
bitten, twice shy!"""
175,16,124,"""I beg your pardon, gentlemen,"" said the old woman, in self - excuse,
""you told me to act as though you knew nothing ...  Well, if you knew
nothing, I should go away with your envelope!"""
175,16,125,"""And then how would you slip it into my pocket?"" argued Richard, whom
Moncharmin fixed with his left eye, while keeping his right on Mme.
Giry:  a proceeding likely to strain his sight, but Moncharmin was
prepared to go to any length to discover the truth."
175,16,126,"""I am to slip it into your pocket when you least expect it, sir.  You
know that I always take a little turn behind the scenes, in the course
of the evening, and I often go with my daughter to the ballet - foyer,
which I am entitled to do, as her mother; I bring her her shoes, when
the ballet is about to begin ... in fact, I come and go as I please ...
The subscribers come and go too...  So do you, sir ...  There are lots
of people about ...  I go behind you and slip the envelope into the
tail - pocket of your dress - coat ...  There's no witchcraft about that!"""
175,16,127,"""No witchcraft!"" growled Richard, rolling his eyes like Jupiter Tonans.
""No witchcraft!  Why, I've just caught you in a lie, you old witch!"""
175,16,128,"Mme. Giry bristled, with her three teeth sticking out of her mouth."
175,16,129,"""And why, may I ask?"""
175,16,130,"""Because I spent that evening watching Box Five and the sham envelope
which you put there.  I did not go to the ballet - foyer for a second."""
175,16,131,"""No, sir, and I did not give you the envelope that evening, but at the
next performance ... on the evening when the under - secretary of state
for fine arts ..."""
175,16,132,"At these words, M. Richard suddenly interrupted Mme. Giry:"
175,16,133,"""Yes, that's true, I remember now!  The under - secretary went behind the
scenes.  He asked for me.  I went down to the ballet - foyer for a
moment.  I was on the foyer steps ...  The under - secretary and his
chief clerk were in the foyer itself.  I suddenly turned around ... you
had passed behind me, Mme. Giry ...  You seemed to push against me ...
Oh, I can see you still, I can see you still!"""
175,16,134,"""Yes, that's it, sir, that's it.  I had just finished my little
business.  That pocket of yours, sir, is very handy!"""
175,16,135,"And Mme. Giry once more suited the action to the word, She passed
behind M. Richard and, so nimbly that Moncharmin himself was impressed
by it, slipped the envelope into the pocket of one of the tails of M.
Richard's dress - coat."
175,16,136,"""Of course!"" exclaimed Richard, looking a little pale.  ""It's very
clever of O. G.  The problem which he had to solve was this: how to do
away with any dangerous intermediary between the man who gives the
twenty - thousand francs and the man who receives it.  And by far the
best thing he could hit upon was to come and take the money from my
pocket without my noticing it, as I myself did not know that it was
there.  It's wonderful!"""
175,16,137,"""Oh, wonderful, no doubt!""  Moncharmin agreed.  ""Only, you forget,
Richard, that I provided ten - thousand francs of the twenty and that
nobody put anything in my pocket!"""
175,16,138,"[1] Flash notes drawn on the ""Bank of St. Farce"" in France correspond
with those drawn on the ""Bank of Engraving"" in England. -  - Translator's
Note."
175,17,1,"Moncharmin's last phrase so dearly expressed the suspicion in which he
now held his partner that it was bound to cause a stormy explanation,
at the end of which it was agreed that Richard should yield to all
Moncharmin's wishes, with the object of helping him to discover the
miscreant who was victimizing them."
175,17,2,"This brings us to the interval after the Garden Act, with the strange
conduct observed by M. Remy and those curious lapses from the dignity
that might be expected of the managers.  It was arranged between
Richard and Moncharmin, first, that Richard should repeat the exact
movements which he had made on the night of the disappearance of the
first twenty - thousand francs; and, second, that Moncharmin should not
for an instant lose sight of Richard's coat - tail pocket, into which
Mme. Giry was to slip the twenty - thousand francs."
175,17,3,"M. Richard went and placed himself at the identical spot where he had
stood when he bowed to the under - secretary for fine arts.  M.
Moncharmin took up his position a few steps behind him."
175,17,4,"Mme. Giry passed, rubbed up against M. Richard, got rid of her
twenty - thousand francs in the manager's coat - tail pocket and
disappeared ...  Or rather she was conjured away.  In accordance with
the instructions received from Moncharmin a few minutes earlier,
Mercier took the good lady to the acting - manager's office and turned
the key on her, thus making it impossible for her to communicate with
her ghost."
175,17,5,"Meanwhile, M. Richard was bending and bowing and scraping and walking
backward, just as if he had that high and mighty minister, the
under - secretary for fine arts, before him.  Only, though these marks of
politeness would have created no astonishment if the under - secretary of
state had really been in front of M. Richard, they caused an easily
comprehensible amazement to the spectators of this very natural but
quite inexplicable scene when M. Richard had no body in front of him."
175,17,6,"M. Richard bowed ... to nobody; bent his back ... before nobody; and
walked backward ... before nobody ...  And, a few steps behind him, M.
Moncharmin did the same thing that he was doing in addition to pushing
away M. Remy and begging M. de La Borderie, the ambassador, and the
manager of the Credit Central ""not to touch M. le Directeur."""
175,17,7,"Moncharmin, who had his own ideas, did not want Richard to come to him
presently, when the twenty - thousand francs were gone, and say:"
175,17,8,"""Perhaps it was the ambassador ... or the manager of the Credit Central
... or Remy."""
175,17,9,"The more so as, at the time of the first scene, as Richard himself
admitted, Richard had met nobody in that part of the theater after Mme.
Giry had brushed up against him..."
175,17,10,"Having begun by walking backward in order to bow, Richard continued to
do so from prudence, until he reached the passage leading to the
offices of the management.  In this way, he was constantly watched by
Moncharmin from behind and himself kept an eye on any one approaching
from the front.  Once more, this novel method of walking behind the
scenes, adopted by the managers of our National Academy of Music,
attracted attention; but the managers themselves thought of nothing but
their twenty - thousand francs."
175,17,11,"On reaching the half - dark passage, Richard said to Moncharmin, in a low
voice:"
175,17,12,"""I am sure that nobody has touched me ...  You had now better keep at
some distance from me and watch me till I come to door of the office:
it is better not to arouse suspicion and we can see anything that
happens."""
175,17,13,"But Moncharmin replied.  ""No, Richard, no!  You walk ahead and I'll
walk immediately behind you!  I won't leave you by a step!"""
175,17,14,"""But, in that case,"" exclaimed Richard, ""they will never steal our
twenty - thousand francs!"""
175,17,15,"""I should hope not, indeed!"" declared Moncharmin."
175,17,16,"""Then what we are doing is absurd!"""
175,17,17,"""We are doing exactly what we did last time ...  Last time, I joined
you as you were leaving the stage and followed close behind you down
this passage."""
175,17,18,"""That's true!"" sighed Richard, shaking his head and passively obeying
Moncharmin."
175,17,19,"Two minutes later, the joint managers locked themselves into their
office.  Moncharmin himself put the key in his pocket:"
175,17,20,"""We remained locked up like this, last time,"" he said, ""until you left
the Opera to go home."""
175,17,21,"""That's so.  No one came and disturbed us, I suppose?"""
175,17,22,"""No one."""
175,17,23,"""Then,"" said Richard, who was trying to collect his memory, ""then I
must certainly have been robbed on my way home from the Opera."""
175,17,24,"""No,"" said Moncharmin in a drier tone than ever, ""no, that's
impossible.  For I dropped you in my cab.  The twenty - thousand francs
disappeared at your place:  there's not a shadow of a doubt about that."""
175,17,25,"""It's incredible!"" protested Richard.  ""I am sure of my servants ...
and if one of them had done it, he would have disappeared since."""
175,17,26,"Moncharmin shrugged his shoulders, as though to say that he did not
wish to enter into details, and Richard began to think that Moncharmin
was treating him in a very insupportable fashion."
175,17,27,"""Moncharmin, I've had enough of this!"""
175,17,28,"""Richard, I've had too much of it!"""
175,17,29,"""Do you dare to suspect me?"""
175,17,30,"""Yes, of a silly joke."""
175,17,31,"""One doesn't joke with twenty - thousand francs."""
175,17,32,"""That's what I think,"" declared Moncharmin, unfolding a newspaper and
ostentatiously studying its contents."
175,17,33,"""What are you doing?"" asked Richard.  ""Are you going to read the paper
next?"""
175,17,34,"""Yes, Richard, until I take you home."""
175,17,35,"""Like last time?"""
175,17,36,"""Yes, like last time."""
175,17,37,"Richard snatched the paper from Moncharmin's hands.  Moncharmin stood
up, more irritated than ever, and found himself faced by an exasperated
Richard, who, crossing his arms on his chest, said:"
175,17,38,"""Look here, I'm thinking of this, I'M THINKING OF WHAT I MIGHT THINK
if, like last time, after my spending the evening alone with you, you
brought me home and if, at the moment of parting, I perceived that
twenty - thousand francs had disappeared from my coat - pocket ... like
last time."""
175,17,39,"""And what might you think?"" asked Moncharmin, crimson with rage."
175,17,40,"""I might think that, as you hadn't left me by a foot's breadth and as,
by your own wish, you were the only one to approach me, like last time,
I might think that, if that twenty - thousand francs was no longer in my
pocket, it stood a very good chance of being in yours!"""
175,17,41,Moncharmin leaped up at the suggestion.
175,17,42,"""Oh!"" he shouted.  ""A safety - pin!"""
175,17,43,"""What do you want a safety - pin for?"""
175,17,44,"""To fasten you up with! ... A safety - pin! ... A safety - pin!"""
175,17,45,"""You want to fasten me with a safety - pin?"""
175,17,46,"""Yes, to fasten you to the twenty - thousand francs!  Then, whether it's
here, or on the drive from here to your place, or at your place, you
will feel the hand that pulls at your pocket and you will see if it's
mine!  Oh, so you're suspecting me now, are you?  A safety - pin!"""
175,17,47,"And that was the moment when Moncharmin opened the door on the passage
and shouted:"
175,17,48,"""A safety - pin! ... somebody give me a safety - pin!"""
175,17,49,"And we also know how, at the same moment, Remy, who had no safety - pin,
was received by Moncharmin, while a boy procured the pin so eagerly
longed for.  And what happened was this:  Moncharmin first locked the
door again.  Then he knelt down behind Richard's back."
175,17,50,"""I hope,"" he said, ""that the notes are still there?"""
175,17,51,"""So do I,"" said Richard."
175,17,52,"""The real ones?"" asked Moncharmin, resolved not to be ""had"" this time."
175,17,53,"""Look for yourself,"" said Richard.  ""I refuse to touch them."""
175,17,54,"Moncharmin took the envelope from Richard's pocket and drew out the
bank - notes with a trembling hand, for, this time, in order frequently
to make sure of the presence of the notes, he had not sealed the
envelope nor even fastened it.  He felt reassured on finding that they
were all there and quite genuine.  He put them back in the tail - pocket
and pinned them with great care.  Then he sat down behind Richard's
coat - tails and kept his eyes fixed on them, while Richard, sitting at
his writing - table, did not stir."
175,17,55,"""A little patience, Richard,"" said Moncharmin.  ""We have only a few
minutes to wait ...  The clock will soon strike twelve.  Last time, we
left at the last stroke of twelve."""
175,17,56,"""Oh, I shall have all the patience necessary!"""
175,17,57,"The time passed, slow, heavy, mysterious, stifling.  Richard tried to
laugh."
175,17,58,"""I shall end by believing in the omnipotence of the ghost,"" he said.
""Just now, don't you find something uncomfortable, disquieting,
alarming in the atmosphere of this room?"""
175,17,59,"""You're quite right,"" said Moncharmin, who was really impressed."
175,17,60,"""The ghost!"" continued Richard, in a low voice, as though fearing lest
he should be overheard by invisible ears.  ""The ghost!  Suppose, all
the same, it were a ghost who puts the magic envelopes on the table ...
who talks in Box Five ... who killed Joseph Buquet ...  who unhooked
the chandelier ... and who robs us!  For, after all, after all, after
all, there is no one here except you and me, and, if the notes
disappear and neither you nor I have anything to do with it, well, we
shall have to believe in the ghost ... in the ghost."""
175,17,61,"At that moment, the clock on the mantlepiece gave its warning click and
the first stroke of twelve struck."
175,17,62,"The two managers shuddered.  The perspiration streamed from their
foreheads.  The twelfth stroke sounded strangely in their ears."
175,17,63,"When the clock stopped, they gave a sigh and rose from their chairs."
175,17,64,"""I think we can go now,"" said Moncharmin."
175,17,65,"""I think so,"" Richard a agreed."
175,17,66,"""Before we go, do you mind if I look in your pocket?"""
175,17,67,"""But, of course, Moncharmin, YOU MUST! ... Well?"" he asked, as
Moncharmin was feeling at the pocket."
175,17,68,"""Well, I can feel the pin."""
175,17,69,"""Of course, as you said, we can't be robbed without noticing it."""
175,17,70,"But Moncharmin, whose hands were still fumbling, bellowed:"
175,17,71,"""I can feel the pin, but I can't feel the notes!"""
175,17,72,"""Come, no joking, Moncharmin! ... This isn't the time for it."""
175,17,73,"""Well, feel for yourself."""
175,17,74,"Richard tore off his coat.  The two managers turned the pocket inside
out.  THE POCKET WAS EMPTY.  And the curious thing was that the pin
remained, stuck in the same place."
175,17,75,"Richard and Moncharmin turned pale.  There was no longer any doubt
about the witchcraft."
175,17,76,"""The ghost!"" muttered Moncharmin."
175,17,77,But Richard suddenly sprang upon his partner.
175,17,78,"""No one but you has touched my pocket!  Give me back my twenty - thousand
francs! ... Give me back my twenty - thousand francs! ..."""
175,17,79,"""On my soul,"" sighed Moncharmin, who was ready to swoon, ""on my soul, I
swear that I haven't got it!"""
175,17,80,"Then somebody knocked at the door.  Moncharmin opened it automatically,
seemed hardly to recognize Mercier, his business - manager, exchanged a
few words with him, without knowing what he was saying and, with an
unconscious movement, put the safety - pin, for which he had no further
use, into the hands of his bewildered subordinate ..."
175,18,1,"The first words of the commissary of police, on entering the managers'
office, were to ask after the missing prima donna."
175,18,2,"""Is Christine Daae here?"""
175,18,3,"""Christine Daae here?"" echoed Richard.  ""No. Why?"""
175,18,4,"As for Moncharmin, he had not the strength left to utter a word."
175,18,5,"Richard repeated, for the commissary and the compact crowd which had
followed him into the office observed an impressive silence."
175,18,6,"""Why do you ask if Christine Daae is here, M. LE COMMISSAIRE?"""
175,18,7,"""Because she has to be found,"" declared the commissary of police
solemnly."
175,18,8,"""What do you mean, she has to be found?  Has she disappeared?"""
175,18,9,"""In the middle of the performance!"""
175,18,10,"""In the middle of the performance?  This is extraordinary!"""
175,18,11,"""Isn't it?  And what is quite as extraordinary is that you should first
learn it from me!"""
175,18,12,"""Yes,"" said Richard, taking his head in his hands and muttering.  ""What
is this new business?  Oh, it's enough to make a man send in his
resignation!"""
175,18,13,"And he pulled a few hairs out of his mustache without even knowing what
he was doing."
175,18,14,"""So she ... so she disappeared in the middle of the performance?"" he
repeated."
175,18,15,"""Yes, she was carried off in the Prison Act, at the moment when she was
invoking the aid of the angels; but I doubt if she was carried off by
an angel."""
175,18,16,"""And I am sure that she was!"""
175,18,17,"Everybody looked round.  A young man, pale and trembling with
excitement, repeated:"
175,18,18,"""I am sure of it!"""
175,18,19,"""Sure of what?"" asked Mifroid."
175,18,20,"""That Christine Daae was carried off by an angel, M. LE COMMISSAIRE and
I can tell you his name."""
175,18,21,"""Aha, M. le Vicomte de Chagny!  So you maintain that Christine Daae was
carried off by an angel:  an angel of the Opera, no doubt?"""
175,18,22,"""Yes, monsieur, by an angel of the Opera; and I will tell you where he
lives ... when we are alone."""
175,18,23,"""You are right, monsieur."""
175,18,24,"And the commissary of police, inviting Raoul to take a chair, cleared
the room of all the rest, excepting the managers."
175,18,25,Then Raoul spoke:
175,18,26,"""M. le Commissaire, the angel is called Erik, he lives in the Opera and
he is the Angel of Music!"""
175,18,27,"""The Angel of Music!  Really!  That is very curious! ... The Angel of
Music!""  And, turning to the managers, M. Mifroid asked, ""Have you an
Angel of Music on the premises, gentlemen?"""
175,18,28,"Richard and Moncharmin shook their heads, without even speaking."
175,18,29,"""Oh,"" said the viscount, ""those gentlemen have heard of the Opera
ghost.  Well, I am in a position to state that the Opera ghost and the
Angel of Music are one and the same person; and his real name is Erik."""
175,18,30,M. Mifroid rose and looked at Raoul attentively.
175,18,31,"""I beg your pardon, monsieur but is it your intention to make fun of
the law?  And, if not, what is all this about the Opera ghost?"""
175,18,32,"""I say that these gentlemen have heard of him."""
175,18,33,"""Gentlemen, it appears that you know the Opera ghost?"""
175,18,34,"Richard rose, with the remaining hairs of his mustache in his hand."
175,18,35,"""No, M. Commissary, no, we do not know him, but we wish that we did,
for this very evening he has robbed us of twenty - thousand francs!"""
175,18,36,"And Richard turned a terrible look on Moncharmin, which seemed to say:"
175,18,37,"""Give me back the twenty - thousand francs, or I'll tell the whole story."""
175,18,38,"Moncharmin understood what he meant, for, with a distracted gesture, he
said:"
175,18,39,"""Oh, tell everything and have done with it!"""
175,18,40,"As for Mifroid, he looked at the managers and at Raoul by turns and
wondered whether he had strayed into a lunatic asylum.  He passed his
hand through his hair."
175,18,41,"""A ghost,"" he said, ""who, on the same evening, carries off an
opera - singer and steals twenty - thousand francs is a ghost who must have
his hands very full!  If you don't mind, we will take the questions in
order.  The singer first, the twenty - thousand francs after.  Come, M.
de Chagny, let us try to talk seriously.  You believe that Mlle.
Christine Daae has been carried off by an individual called Erik.  Do
you know this person?  Have you seen him?"""
175,18,42,"""Yes."""
175,18,43,"""Where?"""
175,18,44,"""In a church yard."""
175,18,45,"M. Mifroid gave a start, began to scrutinize Raoul again and said:"
175,18,46,"""Of course! ... That's where ghosts usually hang out! ... And what were
you doing in that churchyard?"""
175,18,47,"""Monsieur,"" said Raoul, ""I can quite understand how absurd my replies
must seem to you.  But I beg you to believe that I am in full
possession of my faculties.  The safety of the person dearest to me in
the world is at stake.  I should like to convince you in a few words,
for time is pressing and every minute is valuable.  Unfortunately, if I
do not tell you the strangest story that ever was from the beginning,
you will not believe me.  I will tell you all I know about the Opera
ghost, M. Commissary.  Alas, I do not know much! ..."""
175,18,48,"""Never mind, go on, go on!"" exclaimed Richard and Moncharmin, suddenly
greatly interested."
175,18,49,"Unfortunately for their hopes of learning some detail that could put
them on the track of their hoaxer, they were soon compelled to accept
the fact that M. Raoul de Chagny had completely lost his head.  All
that story about Perros - Guirec, death's heads and enchanted violins,
could only have taken birth in the disordered brain of a youth mad with
love.  It was evident, also, that Mr. Commissary Mifroid shared their
view; and the magistrate would certainly have cut short the incoherent
narrative if circumstances had not taken it upon themselves to
interrupt it."
175,18,50,"The door opened and a man entered, curiously dressed in an enormous
frock - coat and a tall hat, at once shabby and shiny, that came down to
his ears.  He went up to the commissary and spoke to him in a whisper.
It was doubtless a detective come to deliver an important communication."
175,18,51,"During this conversation, M. Mifroid did not take his eyes off Raoul.
At last, addressing him, he said:"
175,18,52,"""Monsieur, we have talked enough about the ghost.  We will now talk
about yourself a little, if you have no objection: you were to carry
off Mlle. Christine Daae to - night?"""
175,18,53,"""Yes, M. le Commissaire."""
175,18,54,"""After the performance?"""
175,18,55,"""Yes, M. le Commissaire."""
175,18,56,"""All your arrangements were made?"""
175,18,57,"""Yes, M. le Commissaire."""
175,18,58,"""The carriage that brought you was to take you both away...  There were
fresh horses in readiness at every stage ..."""
175,18,59,"""That is true, M. le Commissaire."""
175,18,60,"""And nevertheless your carriage is still outside the Rotunda awaiting
your orders, is it not?"""
175,18,61,"""Yes, M. le Commissaire."""
175,18,62,"""Did you know that there were three other carriages there, in addition
to yours?"""
175,18,63,"""I did not pay the least attention."""
175,18,64,"""They were the carriages of Mlle. Sorelli, which could not find room in
the Cour de l'Administration; of Carlotta; and of your brother, M. le
Comte de Chagny..."""
175,18,65,"""Very likely..."""
175,18,66,"""What is certain is that, though your carriage and Sorelli's and
Carlotta's are still there, by the Rotunda pavement, M. le Comte de
Chagny's carriage is gone."""
175,18,67,"""This has nothing to say to ..."""
175,18,68,"""I beg your pardon.  Was not M. le Comte opposed to your marriage with
Mlle. Daae?"""
175,18,69,"""That is a matter that only concerns the family."""
175,18,70,"""You have answered my question:  he was opposed to it ... and that was
why you were carrying Christine Daae out of your brother's reach...
Well, M. de Chagny, allow me to inform you that your brother has been
smarter than you!  It is he who has carried off Christine Daae!"""
175,18,71,"""Oh, impossible!"" moaned Raoul, pressing his hand to his heart.  ""Are
you sure?"""
175,18,72,"""Immediately after the artist's disappearance, which was procured by
means which we have still to ascertain, he flung into his carriage,
which drove right across Paris at a furious pace."""
175,18,73,"""Across Paris?"" asked poor Raoul, in a hoarse voice.  ""What do you mean
by across Paris?"""
175,18,74,"""Across Paris and out of Paris ... by the Brussels road."""
175,18,75,"""Oh,"" cried the young man, ""I shall catch them!""  And he rushed out of
the office."
175,18,76,"""And bring her back to us!"" cried the commisary gaily ...  ""Ah, that's
a trick worth two of the Angel of Music's!"""
175,18,77,"And, turning to his audience, M. Mifroid delivered a little lecture on
police methods."
175,18,78,"""I don't know for a moment whether M. le Comte de Chagny has really
carried Christine Daae off or not ... but I want to know and I believe
that, at this moment, no one is more anxious to inform us than his
brother ...  And now he is flying in pursuit of him!  He is my chief
auxiliary!  This, gentlemen, is the art of the police, which is
believed to be so complicated and which, nevertheless appears so simple
as soon its you see that it consists in getting your work done by
people who have nothing to do with the police."""
175,18,79,"But M. le Commissaire de Police Mifroid would not have been quite so
satisfied with himself if he had known that the rush of his rapid
emissary was stopped at the entrance to the very first corridor.  A
tall figure blocked Raoul's way."
175,18,80,"""Where are you going so fast, M. de Chagny?"" asked a voice."
175,18,81,"Raoul impatiently raised his eyes and recognized the astrakhan cap of
an hour ago.  He stopped:"
175,18,82,"""It's you!"" he cried, in a feverish voice.  ""You, who know Erik's
secrets and don't want me to speak of them.  Who are you?"""
175,18,83,"""You know who I am! ... I am the Persian!"""
175,19,1,"Raoul now remembered that his brother had once shown him that
mysterious person, of whom nothing was known except that he was a
Persian and that he lived in a little old - fashioned flat in the Rue de
Rivoli."
175,19,2,"The man with the ebony skin, the eyes of jade and the astrakhan cap
bent over Raoul."
175,19,3,"""I hope, M. de Chagny,"" he said, ""that you have not betrayed Erik's
secret?"""
175,19,4,"""And why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?"" Raoul rejoined
haughtily, trying to shake off the intruder.  ""Is he your friend, by
any chance?"""
175,19,5,"""I hope that you said nothing about Erik, sir, because Erik's secret is
also Christine Daae's and to talk about one is to talk about the other!"""
175,19,6,"""Oh, sir,"" said Raoul, becoming more and more impatient, ""you seem to
know about many things that interest me; and yet I have no time to
listen to you!"""
175,19,7,"""Once more, M. de Chagny, where are you going so fast?"""
175,19,8,"""Can not you guess?  To Christine Daae's assistance..."""
175,19,9,"""Then, sir, stay here, for Christine Daae is here!"""
175,19,10,"""With Erik?"""
175,19,11,"""With Erik."""
175,19,12,"""How do you know?"""
175,19,13,"""I was at the performance and no one in the world but Erik could
contrive an abduction like that! ... Oh,"" he said, with a deep sigh, ""I
recognized the monster's touch! ..."""
175,19,14,"""You know him then?"""
175,19,15,"The Persian did not reply, but heaved a fresh sigh."
175,19,16,"""Sir,"" said Raoul, ""I do not know what your intentions are, but can you
do anything to help me?  I mean, to help Christine Daae?"""
175,19,17,"""I think so, M. de Chagny, and that is why I spoke to you."""
175,19,18,"""What can you do?"""
175,19,19,"""Try to take you to her ... and to him."""
175,19,20,"""If you can do me that service, sir, my life is yours! ... One word
more:  the commissary of police tells me that Christine Daae has been
carried off by my brother, Count Philippe."""
175,19,21,"""Oh, M. de Chagny, I don't believe a word of it."""
175,19,22,"""It's not possible, is it?"""
175,19,23,"""I don't know if it is possible or not; but there are ways and ways of
carrying people off; and M. le Comte Philippe has never, as far as I
know, had anything to do with witchcraft."""
175,19,24,"""Your arguments are convincing, sir, and I am a fool! ... Oh, let us
make haste!  I place myself entirely in your hands! ...  How should I
not believe you, when you are the only one to believe me ... when you
are the only one not to smile when Erik's name is mentioned?"""
175,19,25,"And the young man impetuously seized the Persian's hands.  They were
ice - cold."
175,19,26,"""Silence!"" said the Persian, stopping and listening to the distant
sounds of the theater.  ""We must not mention that name here.  Let us
say 'he' and 'him;' then there will be less danger of attracting his
attention."""
175,19,27,"""Do you think he is near us?"""
175,19,28,"""It is quite possible, Sir, if he is not, at this moment, with his
victim, IN THE HOUSE ON THE LAKE."""
175,19,29,"""Ah, so you know that house too?"""
175,19,30,"""If he is not there, he may be here, in this wall, in this floor, in
this ceiling! ... Come!"""
175,19,31,"And the Persian, asking Raoul to deaden the sound of his footsteps, led
him down passages which Raoul had never seen before, even at the time
when Christine used to take him for walks through that labyrinth."
175,19,32,"""If only Darius has come!"" said the Persian."
175,19,33,"""Who is Darius?"""
175,19,34,"""Darius?  My servant."""
175,19,35,"They were now in the center of a real deserted square, an immense
apartment ill - lit by a small lamp.  The Persian stopped Raoul and, in
the softest of whispers, asked:"
175,19,36,"""What did you say to the commissary?"""
175,19,37,"""I said that Christine Daae's abductor was the Angel of Music, ALIAS
the Opera ghost, and that the real name was ..."""
175,19,38,"""Hush! ... And did he believe you?"""
175,19,39,"""No."""
175,19,40,"""He attached no importance to what you said?"""
175,19,41,"""No."""
175,19,42,"""He took you for a bit of a madman?"""
175,19,43,"""Yes."""
175,19,44,"""So much the better!"" sighed the Persian."
175,19,45,"And they continued their road.  After going up and down several
staircases which Raoul had never seen before, the two men found
themselves in front of a door which the Persian opened with a
master - key. The Persian and Raoul were both, of course, in
dress - clothes; but, whereas Raoul had a tall hat, the Persian wore the
astrakhan cap which I have already mentioned.  It was an infringement
of the rule which insists upon the tall hat behind the scenes; but in
France foreigners are allowed every license: the Englishman his
traveling - cap, the Persian his cap of astrakhan."
175,19,46,"""Sir,"" said the Persian, ""your tall hat will be in your way: you would
do well to leave it in the dressing - room."""
175,19,47,"""What dressing - room?"" asked Raoul."
175,19,48,"""Christine Daae's."""
175,19,49,"And the Persian, letting Raoul through the door which he had just
opened, showed him the actress' room opposite.  They were at the end of
the passage the whole length of which Raoul had been accustomed to
traverse before knocking at Christine's door."
175,19,50,"""How well you know the Opera, sir!"""
175,19,51,"""Not so well as 'he' does!"" said the Persian modestly."
175,19,52,"And he pushed the young man into Christine's dressing - room, which was
as Raoul had left it a few minutes earlier."
175,19,53,"Closing the door, the Persian went to a very thin partition that
separated the dressing - room from a big lumber - room next to it.  He
listened and then coughed loudly."
175,19,54,"There was a sound of some one stirring in the lumber - room; and, a few
seconds later, a finger tapped at the door."
175,19,55,"""Come in,"" said the Persian."
175,19,56,"A man entered, also wearing an astrakhan cap and dressed in a long
overcoat.  He bowed and took a richly carved case from under his coat,
put it on the dressing - table, bowed once again and went to the door."
175,19,57,"""Did no one see you come in, Darius?"""
175,19,58,"""No, master."""
175,19,59,"""Let no one see you go out."""
175,19,60,The servant glanced down the passage and swiftly disappeared.
175,19,61,The Persian opened the case.  It contained a pair of long pistols.
175,19,62,"""When Christine Daae was carried off, sir, I sent word to my servant to
bring me these pistols.  I have had them a long time and they can be
relied upon."""
175,19,63,"""Do you mean to fight a duel?"" asked the young man."
175,19,64,"""It will certainly be a duel which we shall have to fight,"" said the
other, examining the priming of his pistols.  ""And what a duel!""
Handing one of the pistols to Raoul, he added, ""In this duel, we shall
be two to one; but you must be prepared for everything, for we shall be
fighting the most terrible adversary that you can imagine.  But you
love Christine Daae, do you not?"""
175,19,65,"""I worship the ground she stands on!  But you, sir, who do not love
her, tell me why I find you ready to risk your life for her!  You must
certainly hate Erik!"""
175,19,66,"""No, sir,"" said the Persian sadly, ""I do not hate him.  If I hated him,
he would long ago have ceased doing harm."""
175,19,67,"""Has he done you harm?"""
175,19,68,"""I have forgiven him the harm which he has done me."""
175,19,69,"""I do not understand you.  You treat him as a monster, you speak of his
crime, he has done you harm and I find in you the same inexplicable
pity that drove me to despair when I saw it in Christine!"""
175,19,70,"The Persian did not reply.  He fetched a stool and set it against the
wall facing the great mirror that filled the whole of the wall - space
opposite.  Then he climbed on the stool and, with his nose to the
wallpaper, seemed to be looking for something."
175,19,71,"""Ah,"" he said, after a long search, ""I have it!""  And, raising his
finger above his head, he pressed against a corner in the pattern of
the paper.  Then he turned round and jumped off the stool:"
175,19,72,"""In half a minute,"" he said, ""he shall be ON HIS ROAD!"" and crossing
the whole of the dressing - room he felt the great mirror."
175,19,73,"""No, it is not yielding yet,"" he muttered."
175,19,74,"""Oh, are we going out by the mirror?"" asked Raoul.  ""Like Christine
Daae."""
175,19,75,"""So you knew that Christine Daae went out by that mirror?"""
175,19,76,"""She did so before my eyes, sir!  I was hidden behind the curtain of
the inner room and I saw her vanish not by the glass, but in the glass!"""
175,19,77,"""And what did you do?"""
175,19,78,"""I thought it was an aberration of my senses, a mad dream."
175,19,79,"""Or some new fancy of the ghost's!"" chuckled the Persian.  ""Ah, M. de
Chagny,"" he continued, still with his hand on the mirror, ""would that
we had to do with a ghost!  We could then leave our pistols in their
case ...  Put down your hat, please ... there ... and now cover your
shirt - front as much as you can with your coat ... as I am doing ...
Bring the lapels forward ... turn up the collar ...  We must make
ourselves as invisible as possible."""
175,19,80,"Bearing against the mirror, after a short silence, he said:"
175,19,81,"""It takes some time to release the counterbalance, when you press on
the spring from the inside of the room.  It is different when you are
behind the wall and can act directly on the counterbalance.  Then the
mirror turns at once and is moved with incredible rapidity."""
175,19,82,"""What counterbalance?"" asked Raoul."
175,19,83,"""Why, the counterbalance that lifts the whole of this wall on to its
pivot.  You surely don't expect it to move of itself, by enchantment!
If you watch, you will see the mirror first rise an inch or two and
then shift an inch or two from left to right.  It will then be on a
pivot and will swing round."""
175,19,84,"""It's not turning!"" said Raoul impatiently."
175,19,85,"""Oh, wait!  You have time enough to be impatient, sir!  The mechanism
has obviously become rusty, or else the spring isn't working... Unless
it is something else,"" added the Persian, anxiously."
175,19,86,"""What?"""
175,19,87,"""He may simply have cut the cord of the counterbalance and blocked the
whole apparatus."""
175,19,88,"""Why should he?  He does not know that we are coming this way!"""
175,19,89,"""I dare say he suspects it, for he knows that I understand the system."""
175,19,90,"""It's not turning! ... And Christine, sir, Christine?"""
175,19,91,The Persian said coldly:
175,19,92,"""We shall do all that it is humanly possible to do! ... But he may stop
us at the first step! ... He commands the walls, the doors and the
trapdoors.  In my country, he was known by a name which means the
'trap - door lover.'"""
175,19,93,"""But why do these walls obey him alone?  He did not build them!"""
175,19,94,"""Yes, sir, that is just what he did!"""
175,19,95,"Raoul looked at him in amazement; but the Persian made a sign to him to
be silent and pointed to the glass ...  There was a sort of shivering
reflection.  Their image was troubled as in a rippling sheet of water
and then all became stationary again."
175,19,96,"""You see, sir, that it is not turning!  Let us take another road!"""
175,19,97,"""To - night, there is no other!"" declared the Persian, in a singularly
mournful voice.  ""And now, look out!  And be ready to fire."""
175,19,98,"He himself raised his pistol opposite the glass.  Raoul imitated his
movement.  With his free arm, the Persian drew the young man to his
chest and, suddenly, the mirror turned, in a blinding daze of
cross - lights: it turned like one of those revolving doors which have
lately been fixed to the entrances of most restaurants, it turned,
carrying Raoul and the Persian with it and suddenly hurling them from
the full light into the deepest darkness."
175,20,1,"""Your hand high, ready to fire!"" repeated Raoul's companion quickly."
175,20,2,"The wall, behind them, having completed the circle which it described
upon itself, closed again; and the two men stood motionless for a
moment, holding their breath."
175,20,3,"At last, the Persian decided to make a movement; and Raoul heard him
slip on his knees and feel for something in the dark with his groping
hands.  Suddenly, the darkness was made visible by a small dark lantern
and Raoul instinctively stepped backward as though to escape the
scrutiny of a secret enemy.  But he soon perceived that the light
belonged to the Persian, whose movements he was closely observing.  The
little red disk was turned in every direction and Raoul saw that the
floor, the walls and the ceiling were all formed of planking.  It must
have been the ordinary road taken by Erik to reach Christine's
dressing - room and impose upon her innocence.  And Raoul, remembering
the Persian's remark, thought that it had been mysteriously constructed
by the ghost himself.  Later, he learned that Erik had found, all
prepared for him, a secret passage, long known to himself alone and
contrived at the time of the Paris Commune to allow the jailers to
convey their prisoners straight to the dungeons that had been
constructed for them in the cellars; for the Federates had occupied the
opera - house immediately after the eighteenth of March and had made a
starting - place right at the top for their Mongolfier balloons, which
carried their incendiary proclamations to the departments, and a state
prison right at the bottom."
175,20,4,"The Persian went on his knees and put his lantern on the ground.  He
seemed to be working at the floor; and suddenly he turned off his
light.  Then Raoul heard a faint click and saw a very pale luminous
square in the floor of the passage.  It was as though a window had
opened on the Opera cellars, which were still lit.  Raoul no longer saw
the Persian, but he suddenly felt him by his side and heard him whisper:"
175,20,5,"""Follow me and do all that I do."""
175,20,6,"Raoul turned to the luminous aperture.  Then he saw the Persian, who
was still on his knees, hang by his hands from the rim of the opening,
with his pistol between his teeth, and slide into the cellar below."
175,20,7,"Curiously enough, the viscount had absolute confidence in the Persian,
though he knew nothing about him.  His emotion when speaking of the
""monster"" struck him as sincere; and, if the Persian had cherished any
sinister designs against him, he would not have armed him with his own
hands.  Besides, Raoul must reach Christine at all costs.  He therefore
went on his knees also and hung from the trap with both hands."
175,20,8,"""Let go!"" said a voice."
175,20,9,"And he dropped into the arms of the Persian, who told him to lie down
flat, closed the trap - door above him and crouched down beside him.
Raoul tried to ask a question, but the Persian's hand was on his mouth
and he heard a voice which he recognized as that of the commissary of
police."
175,20,10,"Raoul and the Persian were completely hidden behind a wooden partition.
Near them, a small staircase led to a little room in which the
commissary appeared to be walking up and down, asking questions.  The
faint light was just enough to enable Raoul to distinguish the shape of
things around him.  And he could not restrain a dull cry: there were
three corpses there."
175,20,11,"The first lay on the narrow landing of the little staircase; the two
others had rolled to the bottom of the staircase.  Raoul could have
touched one of the two poor wretches by passing his fingers through the
partition."
175,20,12,"""Silence!"" whispered the Persian."
175,20,13,He too had seen the bodies and he gave one word in explanation:
175,20,14,"""HE!"""
175,20,15,"The commissary's voice was now heard more distinctly.  He was asking
for information about the system of lighting, which the stage - manager
supplied.  The commissary therefore must be in the ""organ"" or its
immediate neighborhood."
175,20,16,"Contrary to what one might think, especially in connection with an
opera - house, the ""organ"" is not a musical instrument.  At that time,
electricity was employed only for a very few scenic effects and for the
bells.  The immense building and the stage itself were still lit by
gas; hydrogen was used to regulate and modify the lighting of a scene;
and this was done by means of a special apparatus which, because of the
multiplicity of its pipes, was known as the ""organ."" A box beside the
prompter's box was reserved for the chief gas - man, who from there gave
his orders to his assistants and saw that they were executed.  Mauclair
stayed in this box during all the performances."
175,20,17,"But now Mauclair was not in his box and his assistants not in their
places."
175,20,18,"""Mauclair!  Mauclair!"""
175,20,19,"The stage - manager's voice echoed through the cellars.  But Mauclair did
not reply."
175,20,20,"I have said that a door opened on a little staircase that led to the
second cellar.  The commissary pushed it, but it resisted."
175,20,21,"""I say,"" he said to the stage - manager, ""I can't open this door: is it
always so difficult?"""
175,20,22,"The stage - manager forced it open with his shoulder.  He saw that, at
the same time, he was pushing a human body and he could not keep back
an exclamation, for he recognized the body at once:"
175,20,23,"""Mauclair!  Poor devil!  He is dead!"""
175,20,24,"But Mr. Commissary Mifroid, whom nothing surprised, was stooping over
that big body."
175,20,25,"""No,"" he said, ""he is dead - drunk, which is not quite the same thing."""
175,20,26,"""It's the first time, if so,"" said the stage - manager"
175,20,27,"""Then some one has given him a narcotic.  That is quite possible."""
175,20,28,Mifroid went down a few steps and said:
175,20,29,"""Look!"""
175,20,30,"By the light of a little red lantern, at the foot of the stairs, they
saw two other bodies.  The stage - manager recognized Mauclair's
assistants.  Mifroid went down and listened to their breathing."
175,20,31,"""They are sound asleep,"" he said.  ""Very curious business!  Some person
unknown must have interfered with the gas - man and his staff ... and
that person unknown was obviously working on behalf of the kidnapper
...  But what a funny idea to kidnap a performer on the stage! ... Send
for the doctor of the theater, please."" And Mifroid repeated, ""Curious,
decidedly curious business!"""
175,20,32,"Then he turned to the little room, addressing the people whom Raoul and
the Persian were unable to see from where they lay."
175,20,33,"""What do you say to all this, gentlemen?  You are the only ones who
have not given your views.  And yet you must have an opinion of some
sort."""
175,20,34,"Thereupon, Raoul and the Persian saw the startled faces of the joint
managers appear above the landing -  - and they heard Moncharmin's excited
voice:"
175,20,35,"""There are things happening here, Mr. Commissary, which we are unable
to explain."""
175,20,36,And the two faces disappeared.
175,20,37,"""Thank you for the information, gentlemen,"" said Mifroid, with a jeer."
175,20,38,"But the stage - manager, holding his chin in the hollow of his right
hand, which is the attitude of profound thought, said:"
175,20,39,"""It is not the first time that Mauclair has fallen asleep in the
theater.  I remember finding him, one evening, snoring in his little
recess, with his snuff - box beside him."""
175,20,40,"""Is that long ago?"" asked M. Mifroid, carefully wiping his eye - glasses."
175,20,41,"""No, not so very long ago ...  Wait a bit! ... It was the night ... of
course, yes ... It was the night when Carlotta -  - you know, Mr.
Commissary -  - gave her famous 'co - ack'!"""
175,20,42,"""Really?  The night when Carlotta gave her famous 'co - ack'?"""
175,20,43,"And M. Mifroid, replacing his gleaming glasses on his nose, fixed the
stage - manager with a contemplative stare."
175,20,44,"""So Mauclair takes snuff, does he?"" he asked carelessly."
175,20,45,"""'Yes, Mr. Commissary ...  Look, there is his snuff - box on that little
shelf ...  Oh! he's a great snuff - taker!"""
175,20,46,"""So am I,"" said Mifroid and put the snuff - box in his pocket."
175,20,47,"Raoul and the Persian, themselves unobserved, watched the removal of
the three bodies by a number of scene - shifters, who were followed by
the commissary and all the people with him.  Their steps were heard for
a few minutes on the stage above.  When they were alone the Persian
made a sign to Raoul to stand up.  Raoul did so; but, as he did not
lift his hand in front of his eyes, ready to fire, the Persian told him
to resume that attitude and to continue it, whatever happened."
175,20,48,"""But it tires the hand unnecessarily,"" whispered Raoul.  ""If I do fire,
I shan't be sure of my aim."""
175,20,49,"""Then shift your pistol to the other hand,"" said the Persian."
175,20,50,"""I can't shoot with my left hand."""
175,20,51,"Thereupon, the Persian made this queer reply, which was certainly not
calculated to throw light into the young man's flurried brain:"
175,20,52,"""It's not a question of shooting with the right hand or the left; it's
a question of holding one of your hands as though you were going to
pull the trigger of a pistol with your arm bent.  As for the pistol
itself, when all is said, you can put that in your pocket!""  And he
added, ""Let this be clearly understood, or I will answer for nothing.
It is a matter of life and death.  And now, silence and follow me!"""
175,20,53,"The cellars of the Opera are enormous and they are five in number.
Raoul followed the Persian and wondered what he would have done without
his companion in that extraordinary labyrinth.  They went down to the
third cellar; and their progress was still lit by some distant lamp."
175,20,54,"The lower they went, the more precautions the Persian seemed to take.
He kept on turning to Raoul to see if he was holding his arm properly,
showing him how he himself carried his hand as if always ready to fire,
though the pistol was in his pocket."
175,20,55,"Suddenly, a loud voice made them stop.  Some one above them shouted:"
175,20,56,"""All the door - shutters on the stage!  The commissary of police wants
them!"""
175,20,57,"Steps were heard and shadows glided through the darkness.  The Persian
drew Raoul behind a set piece.  They saw passing before and above them
old men bent by age and the past burden of opera - scenery.  Some could
hardly drag themselves along; others, from habit, with stooping bodies
and outstretched hands, looked for doors to shut."
175,20,58,"They were the door - shutters, the old, worn - out scene - shifters, on whom
a charitable management had taken pity, giving them the job of shutting
doors above and below the stage.  They went about incessantly, from top
to bottom of the building, shutting the doors; and they were also
called ""The draft - expellers,"" at least at that time, for I have little
doubt that by now they are all dead.  Drafts are very bad for the
voice, wherever they may come from.[1]"
175,20,59,"The two men might have stumbled over them, waking them up and provoking
a request for explanations.  For the moment, M. Mifroid's inquiry saved
them from any such unpleasant encounters."
175,20,60,"The Persian and Raoul welcomed this incident, which relieved them of
inconvenient witnesses, for some of those door - shutters, having nothing
else to do or nowhere to lay their heads, stayed at the Opera, from
idleness or necessity, and spent the night there."
175,20,61,"But they were not left to enjoy their solitude for long.  Other shades
now came down by the same way by which the door - shutters had gone up.
Each of these shades carried a little lantern and moved it about,
above, below and all around, as though looking for something or
somebody."
175,20,62,"""Hang it!"" muttered the Persian.  ""I don't know what they are looking
for, but they might easily find us ...  Let us get away, quick! ...
Your hand up, sir, ready to fire! ... Bend your arm ... more ... that's
it! ... Hand at the level of your eye, as though you were fighting a
duel and waiting for the word to fire!  Oh, leave your pistol in your
pocket.  Quick, come along, down - stairs.  Level of your eye!  Question
of life or death! ...  Here, this way, these stairs!""  They reached the
fifth cellar.  ""Oh, what a duel, sir, what a duel!"""
175,20,63,"Once in the fifth cellar, the Persian drew breath.  He seemed to enjoy
a rather greater sense of security than he had displayed when they both
stopped in the third; but he never altered the attitude of his hand.
And Raoul, remembering the Persian's observation -  - ""I know these pistols
can be relied upon"" -  - was more and more astonished, wondering why any
one should be so gratified at being able to rely upon a pistol which he
did not intend to use!"
175,20,64,"But the Persian left him no time for reflection.  Telling Raoul to stay
where he was, he ran up a few steps of the staircase which they had
just left and then returned."
175,20,65,"""How stupid of us!"" he whispered.  ""We shall soon have seen the end of
those men with their lanterns.  It is the firemen going their
rounds.""[2]"
175,20,66,"The two men waited five minutes longer.  Then the Persian took Raoul up
the stairs again; but suddenly he stopped him with a gesture.
Something moved in the darkness before them."
175,20,67,"""Flat on your stomach!"" whispered the Persian."
175,20,68,The two men lay flat on the floor.
175,20,69,"They were only just in time.  A shade, this time carrying no light,
just a shade in the shade, passed.  It passed close to them, near
enough to touch them."
175,20,70,"They felt the warmth of its cloak upon them.  For they could
distinguish the shade sufficiently to see that it wore a cloak which
shrouded it from head to foot.  On its head it had a soft felt hat ..."
175,20,71,"It moved away, drawing its feet against the walls and sometimes giving
a kick into a corner."
175,20,72,"""Whew!"" said the Persian.  ""We've had a narrow escape; that shade knows
me and has twice taken me to the managers' office."""
175,20,73,"""Is it some one belonging to the theater police?"" asked Raoul."
175,20,74,"""It's some one much worse than that!"" replied the Persian, without
giving any further explanation.[3]"
175,20,75,"""It's not ... he?"""
175,20,76,"""He? ... If he does not come behind us, we shall always see his yellow
eyes!  That is more or less our safeguard to - night. But he may come
from behind, stealing up; and we are dead men if we do not keep our
hands as though about to fire, at the level of our eyes, in front!"""
175,20,77,"The Persian had hardly finished speaking, when a fantastic face came in
sight ... a whole fiery face, not only two yellow eyes!"
175,20,78,"Yes, a head of fire came toward them, at a man's height, but with no
body attached to it.  The face shed fire, looked in the darkness like a
flame shaped as a man's face."
175,20,79,"""Oh,"" said the Persian, between his teeth.  ""I have never seen this
before! ... Pampin was not mad, after all: he had seen it! ...  What
can that flame be?  It is not HE, but he may have sent it!  ... Take
care! ... Take care!  Your hand at the level of your eyes, in Heaven's
name, at the level of your eyes! ... know most of his tricks ...  but
not this one ...  Come, let us run ...  it is safer.  Hand at the level
of your eyes!"""
175,20,80,And they fled down the long passage that opened before them.
175,20,81,"After a few seconds, that seemed to them like long minutes, they
stopped."
175,20,82,"""He doesn't often come this way,"" said the Persian.  ""This side has
nothing to do with him.  This side does not lead to the lake nor to the
house on the lake ...  But perhaps he knows that we are at his heels
... although I promised him to leave him alone and never to meddle in
his business again!"""
175,20,83,"So saying, he turned his head and Raoul also turned his head; and they
again saw the head of fire behind their two heads.  It had followed
them.  And it must have run also, and perhaps faster than they, for it
seemed to be nearer to them."
175,20,84,"At the same time, they began to perceive a certain noise of which they
could not guess the nature.  They simply noticed that the sound seemed
to move and to approach with the fiery face.  It was a noise as though
thousands of nails had been scraped against a blackboard, the perfectly
unendurable noise that is sometimes made by a little stone inside the
chalk that grates on the blackboard."
175,20,85,"They continued to retreat, but the fiery face came on, came on, gaining
on them.  They could see its features clearly now.  The eyes were round
and staring, the nose a little crooked and the mouth large, with a
hanging lower lip, very like the eyes, nose and lip of the moon, when
the moon is quite red, bright red."
175,20,86,"How did that red moon manage to glide through the darkness, at a man's
height, with nothing to support it, at least apparently?  And how did
it go so fast, so straight ahead, with such staring, staring eyes?  And
what was that scratching, scraping, grating sound which it brought with
it?"
175,20,87,"The Persian and Raoul could retreat no farther and flattened themselves
against the wall, not knowing what was going to happen because of that
incomprehensible head of fire, and especially now, because of the more
intense, swarming, living, ""numerous"" sound, for the sound was
certainly made up of hundreds of little sounds that moved in the
darkness, under the fiery face."
175,20,88,"And the fiery face came on ... with its noise ... came level with them!
..."
175,20,89,"And the two companions, flat against their wall, felt their hair stand
on end with horror, for they now knew what the thousand noises meant.
They came in a troop, hustled along in the shadow by innumerable little
hurried waves, swifter than the waves that rush over the sands at high
tide, little night - waves foaming under the moon, under the fiery head
that was like a moon.  And the little waves passed between their legs,
climbing up their legs, irresistibly, and Raoul and the Persian could
no longer restrain their cries of horror, dismay and pain.  Nor could
they continue to hold their hands at the level of their eyes: their
hands went down to their legs to push back the waves, which were full
of little legs and nails and claws and teeth."
175,20,90,"Yes, Raoul and the Persian were ready to faint, like Pampin the
fireman.  But the head of fire turned round in answer to their cries,
and spoke to them:"
175,20,91,"""Don't move!  Don't move! ... Whatever you do, don't come after me!
...  I am the rat - catcher! ... Let me pass, with my rats! ..."""
175,20,92,"And the head of fire disappeared, vanished in the darkness, while the
passage in front of it lit up, as the result of the change which the
rat - catcher had made in his dark lantern.  Before, so as not to scare
the rats in front of him, he had turned his dark lantern on himself,
lighting up his own head; now, to hasten their flight, he lit the dark
space in front of him.  And he jumped along, dragging with him the
waves of scratching rats, all the thousand sounds."
175,20,93,"Raoul and the Persian breathed again, though still trembling."
175,20,94,"""I ought to have remembered that Erik talked to me about the
rat - catcher,"" said the Persian.  ""But he never told me that he looked
like that ...  and it's funny that I should never have met him before
...  Of course, Erik never comes to this part!"""
175,20,95,[Illustration: two page color illustration]
175,20,96,"""Are we very far from the lake, sir?"" asked Raoul.  ""When shall we get
there? ... Take me to the lake, oh, take me to the lake! ...  When we
are at the lake, we will call out! ... Christine will hear us! ... And
HE will hear us, too! ... And, as you know him, we shall talk to him!""
""Baby!"" said the Persian.  ""We shall never enter the house on the lake
by the lake! ... I myself have never landed on the other bank ... the
bank on which the house stands.  ... You have to cross the lake first
... and it is well guarded!  ... I fear that more than one of those
men -  - old scene - shifters, old door - shutters -  - who have never been seen
again were simply tempted to cross the lake ...  It is terrible ...  I
myself would have been nearly killed there ... if the monster had not
recognized me in time!  ... One piece of advice, sir; never go near the
lake... And, above all, shut your ears if you hear the voice singing
under the water, the siren's voice!"""
175,20,97,"""But then, what are we here for?"" asked Raoul, in a transport of fever,
impatience and rage.  ""If you can do nothing for Christine, at least
let me die for her!""  The Persian tried to calm the young man."
175,20,98,"""We have only one means of saving Christine Daae, believe me, which is
to enter the house unperceived by the monster."""
175,20,99,"""And is there any hope of that, sir?"""
175,20,100,"""Ah, if I had not that hope, I would not have come to fetch you!"""
175,20,101,"""And how can one enter the house on the lake without crossing the lake?"""
175,20,102,"""From the third cellar, from which we were so unluckily driven away.
We will go back there now ...  I will tell you,"" said the Persian, with
a sudden change in his voice, ""I will tell you the exact place, sir: it
is between a set piece and a discarded scene from ROI DE LAHORE,
exactly at the spot where Joseph Buquet died...  Come, sir, take
courage and follow me!  And hold your hand at the level of your eyes!
... But where are we?"""
175,20,103,"The Persian lit his lamp again and flung its rays down two enormous
corridors that crossed each other at right angles."
175,20,104,"""We must be,"" he said, ""in the part used more particularly for the
waterworks.  I see no fire coming from the furnaces."""
175,20,105,"He went in front of Raoul, seeking his road, stopping abruptly when he
was afraid of meeting some waterman.  Then they had to protect
themselves against the glow of a sort of underground forge, which the
men were extinguishing, and at which Raoul recognized the demons whom
Christine had seen at the time of her first captivity."
175,20,106,"In this way, they gradually arrived beneath the huge cellars below the
stage.  They must at this time have been at the very bottom of the
""tub"" and at an extremely great depth, when we remember that the earth
was dug out at fifty feet below the water that lay under the whole of
that part of Paris.[4]"
175,20,107,The Persian touched a partition - wall and said:
175,20,108,"""If I am not mistaken, this is a wall that might easily belong to the
house on the lake."""
175,20,109,"He was striking a partition - wall of the ""tub,"" and perhaps it would be
as well for the reader to know how the bottom and the partition - walls
of the tub were built.  In order to prevent the water surrounding the
building - operations from remaining in immediate contact with the walls
supporting the whole of the theatrical machinery, the architect was
obliged to build a double case in every direction.  The work of
constructing this double case took a whole year.  It was the wall of
the first inner case that the Persian struck when speaking to Raoul of
the house on the lake.  To any one understanding the architecture of
the edifice, the Persian's action would seem to indicate that Erik's
mysterious house had been built in the double case, formed of a thick
wall constructed as an embankment or dam, then of a brick wall, a
tremendous layer of cement and another wall several yards in thickness."
175,20,110,"At the Persian's words, Raoul flung himself against the wall and
listened eagerly.  But he heard nothing ... nothing ... except distant
steps sounding on the floor of the upper portions of the theater."
175,20,111,The Persian darkened his lantern again.
175,20,112,"""Look out!"" he said.  ""Keep your hand up!  And silence!  For we shall
try another way of getting in."""
175,20,113,"And he led him to the little staircase by which they had come down
lately."
175,20,114,"They went up, stopping at each step, peering into the darkness and the
silence, till they came to the third cellar.  Here the Persian motioned
to Raoul to go on his knees; and, in this way, crawling on both knees
and one hand -  - for the other hand was held in the position
indicated -  - they reached the end wall."
175,20,115,"Against this wall stood a large discarded scene from the ROI DE LAHORE.
Close to this scene was a set piece.  Between the scene and the set
piece there was just room for a body ... for a body which one day was
found hanging there.  The body of Joseph Buquet."
175,20,116,"The Persian, still kneeling, stopped and listened.  For a moment, he
seemed to hesitate and looked at Raoul; then he turned his eyes upward,
toward the second cellar, which sent down the faint glimmer of a
lantern, through a cranny between two boards.  This glimmer seemed to
trouble the Persian."
175,20,117,"At last, he tossed his head and made up his mind to act.  He slipped
between the set piece and the scene from the ROI DE LAHORE, with Raoul
close upon his heels.  With his free hand, the Persian felt the wall.
Raoul saw him bear heavily upon the wall, just as he had pressed
against the wall in Christine's dressing - room. Then a stone gave way,
leaving a hole in the wall."
175,20,118,"This time, the Persian took his pistol from his pocket and made a sign
to Raoul to do as he did.  He cocked the pistol."
175,20,119,"And, resolutely, still on his knees, he wiggled through the hole in the
wall.  Raoul, who had wished to pass first, had to be content to follow
him."
175,20,120,"The hole was very narrow.  The Persian stopped almost at once.  Raoul
heard him feeling the stones around him.  Then the Persian took out his
dark lantern again, stooped forward, examined something beneath him and
immediately extinguished his lantern.  Raoul heard him say, in a
whisper:"
175,20,121,"""We shall have to drop a few yards, without making a noise; take off
your boots."""
175,20,122,The Persian handed his own shoes to Raoul.
175,20,123,"""Put them outside the wall,"" he said.  ""We shall find them there when
we leave.""[5]"
175,20,124,"He crawled a little farther on his knees, then turned right round and
said:"
175,20,125,"""I am going to hang by my hands from the edge of the stone and let
myself drop INTO HIS HOUSE.  You must do exactly the same.  Do not be
afraid.  I will catch you in my arms."""
175,20,126,"Raoul soon heard a dull sound, evidently produced by the fall of the
Persian, and then dropped down."
175,20,127,He felt himself clasped in the Persian's arms.
175,20,128,"""Hush!"" said the Persian."
175,20,129,"And they stood motionless, listening."
175,20,130,"The darkness was thick around them, the silence heavy and terrible."
175,20,131,"Then the Persian began to make play with the dark lantern again,
turning the rays over their heads, looking for the hole through which
they had come, and failing to find it:"
175,20,132,"""Oh!"" he said.  ""The stone has closed of itself!"""
175,20,133,And the light of the lantern swept down the wall and over the floor.
175,20,134,"The Persian stooped and picked up something, a sort of cord, which he
examined for a second and flung away with horror."
175,20,135,"""The Punjab lasso!"" he muttered."
175,20,136,"""What is it?"" asked Raoul."
175,20,137,"The Persian shivered.  ""It might very well be the rope by which the man
was hanged, and which was looked for so long."""
175,20,138,"And, suddenly seized with fresh anxiety, he moved the little red disk
of his lantern over the walls.  In this way, he lit up a curious thing:
the trunk of a tree, which seemed still quite alive, with its leaves;
and the branches of that tree ran right up the walls and disappeared in
the ceiling."
175,20,139,"Because of the smallness of the luminous disk, it was difficult at
first to make out the appearance of things:  they saw a corner of a
branch ... and a leaf ... and another leaf ... and, next to it, nothing
at all, nothing but the ray of light that seemed to reflect itself ...
Raoul passed his hand over that nothing, over that reflection."
175,20,140,"""Hullo!"" he said.  ""The wall is a looking - glass!"""
175,20,141,"""Yes, a looking - glass!"" said the Persian, in a tone of deep emotion.
And, passing the hand that held the pistol over his moist forehead, he
added, ""We have dropped into the torture - chamber!"""
175,20,142,"What the Persian knew of this torture - chamber and what there befell him
and his companion shall be told in his own words, as set down in a
manuscript which he left behind him, and which I copy VERBATIM."
175,20,143,"[1] M. Pedro Gailhard has himself told me that he created a few
additional posts as door - shutters for old stage - carpenters whom he was
unwilling to dismiss from the service of the Opera."
175,20,144,"[2] In those days, it was still part of the firemen's duty to watch
over the safety of the Opera house outside the performances; but this
service has since been suppressed.  I asked M. Pedro Gailhard the
reason, and he replied:"
175,20,145,"""It was because the management was afraid that, in their utter
inexperience of the cellars of the Opera, the firemen might set fire to
the building!"""
175,20,146,"[3] Like the Persian, I can give no further explanation touching the
apparition of this shade.  Whereas, in this historic narrative,
everything else will be normally explained, however abnormal the course
of events may seem, I can not give the reader expressly to understand
what the Persian meant by the words, ""It is some one much worse than
that!""  The reader must try to guess for himself, for I promised M.
Pedro Gailhard, the former manager of the Opera, to keep his secret
regarding the extremely interesting and useful personality of the
wandering, cloaked shade which, while condemning itself to live in the
cellars of the Opera, rendered such immense services to those who, on
gala evenings, for instance, venture to stray away from the stage.  I
am speaking of state services; and, upon my word of honor, I can say no
more."
175,20,147,"[4] All the water had to be exhausted, in the building of the Opera.
To give an idea of the amount of water that was pumped up, I can tell
the reader that it represented the area of the courtyard of the Louvre
and a height half as deep again as the towers of Notre Dame.  And
nevertheless the engineers had to leave a lake."
175,20,148,"[5] These two pairs of boots, which were placed, according to the
Persian's papers, just between the set piece and the scene from the ROI
DE LAHORE, on the spot where Joseph Buquet was found hanging, were
never discovered.  They must have been taken by some stage - carpenter or
""door - shutter."""
175,21,0,the Cellars of the Opera
175,21,1,THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE
175,21,2,"It was the first time that I entered the house on the lake.  I had
often begged the ""trap - door lover,"" as we used to call Erik in my
country, to open its mysterious doors to me.  He always refused.  I
made very many attempts, but in vain, to obtain admittance.  Watch him
as I might, after I first learned that he had taken up his permanent
abode at the Opera, the darkness was always too thick to enable me to
see how he worked the door in the wall on the lake.  One day, when I
thought myself alone, I stepped into the boat and rowed toward that
part of the wall through which I had seen Erik disappear.  It was then
that I came into contact with the siren who guarded the approach and
whose charm was very nearly fatal to me."
175,21,3,"I had no sooner put off from the bank than the silence amid which I
floated on the water was disturbed by a sort of whispered singing that
hovered all around me.  It was half breath, half music; it rose softly
from the waters of the lake; and I was surrounded by it through I knew
not what artifice.  It followed me, moved with me and was so soft that
it did not alarm me.  On the contrary, in my longing to approach the
source of that sweet and enticing harmony, I leaned out of my little
boat over the water, for there was no doubt in my mind that the singing
came from the water itself.  By this time, I was alone in the boat in
the middle of the lake; the voice -  - for it was now distinctly a
voice -  - was beside me, on the water.  I leaned over, leaned still
farther.  The lake was perfectly calm, and a moonbeam that passed
through the air hole in the Rue Scribe showed me absolutely nothing on
its surface, which was smooth and black as ink.  I shook my ears to get
rid of a possible humming; but I soon had to accept the fact that there
was no humming in the ears so harmonious as the singing whisper that
followed and now attracted me."
175,21,4,"Had I been inclined to superstition, I should have certainly thought
that I had to do with some siren whose business it was to confound the
traveler who should venture on the waters of the house on the lake.
Fortunately, I come from a country where we are too fond of fantastic
things not to know them through and through; and I had no doubt but
that I was face to face with some new invention of Erik's. But this
invention was so perfect that, as I leaned out of the boat, I was
impelled less by a desire to discover its trick than to enjoy its
charm; and I leaned out, leaned out until I almost overturned the boat."
175,21,5,"Suddenly, two monstrous arms issued from the bosom of the waters and
seized me by the neck, dragging me down to the depths with irresistible
force.  I should certainly have been lost, if I had not had time to
give a cry by which Erik knew me.  For it was he; and, instead of
drowning me, as was certainly his first intention, he swam with me and
laid me gently on the bank:"
175,21,6,"""How imprudent you are!"" he said, as he stood before me, dripping with
water.  ""Why try to enter my house?  I never invited you!  I don't want
you there, nor anybody!  Did you save my life only to make it
unbearable to me?  However great the service you rendered him, Erik may
end by forgetting it; and you know that nothing can restrain Erik, not
even Erik himself."""
175,21,7,"He spoke, but I had now no other wish than to know what I already
called the trick of the siren.  He satisfied my curiosity, for Erik,
who is a real monster -  - I have seen him at work in Persia, alas -  - is
also, in certain respects, a regular child, vain and self - conceited,
and there is nothing he loves so much, after astonishing people, as to
prove all the really miraculous ingenuity of his mind."
175,21,8,He laughed and showed me a long reed.
175,21,9,"""It's the silliest trick you ever saw,"" he said, ""but it's very useful
for breathing and singing in the water.  I learned it from the Tonkin
pirates, who are able to remain hidden for hours in the beds of the
rivers.""[1]"
175,21,10,I spoke to him severely.
175,21,11,"""It's a trick that nearly killed me!""  I said.  ""And it may have been
fatal to others!  You know what you promised me, Erik?  No more
murders!"""
175,21,12,"""Have I really committed murders?"" he asked, putting on his most
amiable air."
175,21,13,"""Wretched man!""  I cried.  ""Have you forgotten the rosy hours of
Mazenderan?"""
175,21,14,"""Yes,"" he replied, in a sadder tone, ""I prefer to forget them.  I used
to make the little sultana laugh, though!"""
175,21,15,"""All that belongs to the past,"" I declared; ""but there is the present
... and you are responsible to me for the present, because, if I had
wished, there would have been none at all for you.  Remember that,
Erik:  I saved your life!"""
175,21,16,"And I took advantage of the turn of conversation to speak to him of
something that had long been on my mind:"
175,21,17,"""Erik,"" I asked, ""Erik, swear that ..."""
175,21,18,"""What?"" he retorted.  ""You know I never keep my oaths.  Oaths are made
to catch gulls with."""
175,21,19,"""Tell me ... you can tell me, at any rate..."""
175,21,20,"""Well?"""
175,21,21,"""Well, the chandelier ... the chandelier, Erik? ..."""
175,21,22,"""What about the chandelier?"""
175,21,23,"""You know what I mean."""
175,21,24,"""Oh,"" he sniggered, ""I don't mind telling you about the chandelier!
... IT WASN'T I! ... The chandelier was very old and worn."""
175,21,25,"When Erik laughed, he was more terrible than ever.  He jumped into the
boat, chuckling so horribly that I could not help trembling."
175,21,26,"""Very old and worn, my dear daroga![2]  Very old and worn, the
chandelier! ... It fell of itself! ... It came down with a smash! ...
And now, daroga, take my advice and go and dry yourself, or you'll
catch a cold in the head! ...  And never get into my boat again ...
And, whatever you do, don't try to enter my house:  I'm not always
there ... daroga!  And I should be sorry to have to dedicate my Requiem
Mass to you!"""
175,21,27,"So saying, swinging to and fro, like a monkey, and still chuckling, he
pushed off and soon disappeared in the darkness of the lake."
175,21,28,"From that day, I gave up all thought of penetrating into his house by
the lake.  That entrance was obviously too well guarded, especially
since he had learned that I knew about it.  But I felt that there must
be another entrance, for I had often seen Erik disappear in the third
cellar, when I was watching him, though I could not imagine how."
175,21,29,"Ever since I had discovered Erik installed in the Opera, I lived in a
perpetual terror of his horrible fancies, not in so far as I was
concerned, but I dreaded everything for others.[3]"
175,21,30,"And whenever some accident, some fatal event happened, I always thought
to myself, ""I should not be surprised if that were Erik,"" even as
others used to say, ""It's the ghost!""  How often have I not heard
people utter that phrase with a smile!  Poor devils!  If they had known
that the ghost existed in the flesh, I swear they would not have
laughed!"
175,21,31,"Although Erik announced to me very solemnly that he had changed and
that he had become the most virtuous of men SINCE HE WAS LOVED FOR
HIMSELF -  - a sentence that, at first, perplexed me most terribly -  - I could
not help shuddering when I thought of the monster.  His horrible,
unparalleled and repulsive ugliness put him without the pale of
humanity; and it often seemed to me that, for this reason, he no longer
believed that he had any duty toward the human race.  The way in which
he spoke of his love affairs only increased my alarm, for I foresaw the
cause of fresh and more hideous tragedies in this event to which he
alluded so boastfully."
175,21,32,"On the other hand, I soon discovered the curious moral traffic
established between the monster and Christine Daae.  Hiding in the
lumber - room next to the young prima donna's dressing - room, I listened
to wonderful musical displays that evidently flung Christine into
marvelous ecstasy; but, all the same, I would never have thought that
Erik's voice -  - which was loud as thunder or soft as angels' voices, at
will -  - could have made her forget his ugliness.  I understood all when I
learned that Christine had not yet seen him!  I had occasion to go to
the dressing - room and, remembering the lessons he had once given me, I
had no difficulty in discovering the trick that made the wall with the
mirror swing round and I ascertained the means of hollow bricks and so
on -  - by which he made his voice carry to Christine as though she heard
it close beside her.  In this way also I discovered the road that led
to the well and the dungeon -  - the Communists' dungeon -  - and also the
trap - door that enabled Erik to go straight to the cellars below the
stage."
175,21,33,"A few days later, what was not my amazement to learn by my own eyes and
ears that Erik and Christine Daae saw each other and to catch the
monster stooping over the little well, in the Communists' road and
sprinkling the forehead of Christine Daae, who had fainted.  A white
horse, the horse out of the PROFETA, which had disappeared from the
stables under the Opera, was standing quietly beside them.  I showed
myself.  It was terrible.  I saw sparks fly from those yellow eyes and,
before I had time to say a word, I received a blow on the head that
stunned me."
175,21,34,"When I came to myself, Erik, Christine and the white horse had
disappeared.  I felt sure that the poor girl was a prisoner in the
house on the lake.  Without hesitation, I resolved to return to the
bank, notwithstanding the attendant danger.  For twenty - four hours, I
lay in wait for the monster to appear; for I felt that he must go out,
driven by the need of obtaining provisions.  And, in this connection, I
may say, that, when he went out in the streets or ventured to show
himself in public, he wore a pasteboard nose, with a mustache attached
to it, instead of his own horrible hole of a nose.  This did not quite
take away his corpse - like air, but it made him almost, I say almost,
endurable to look at."
175,21,35,"I therefore watched on the bank of the lake and, weary of long waiting,
was beginning to think that he had gone through the other door, the
door in the third cellar, when I heard a slight splashing in the dark,
I saw the two yellow eyes shining like candles and soon the boat
touched shore.  Erik jumped out and walked up to me:"
175,21,36,"""You've been here for twenty - four hours,"" he said, ""and you're annoying
me.  I tell you, all this will end very badly.  And you will have
brought it upon yourself; for I have been extraordinarily patient with
you.  You think you are following me, you great booby, whereas it's I
who am following you; and I know all that you know about me, here.  I
spared you yesterday, in MY COMMUNISTS' ROAD; but I warn you,
seriously, don't let me catch you there again!  Upon my word, you don't
seem able to take a hint!"""
175,21,37,"He was so furious that I did not think, for the moment, of interrupting
him.  After puffing and blowing like a walrus, he put his horrible
thought into words:"
175,21,38,"""Yes, you must learn, once and for all -  - once and for all, I say -  - to
take a hint!  I tell you that, with your recklessness -  - for you have
already been twice arrested by the shade in the felt hat, who did not
know what you were doing in the cellars and took you to the managers,
who looked upon you as an eccentric Persian interested in stage
mechanism and life behind the scenes:  I know all about it, I was
there, in the office; you know I am everywhere -  - well, I tell you that,
with your recklessness, they will end by wondering what you are after
here ... and they will end by knowing that you are after Erik ... and
then they will be after Erik themselves and they will discover the
house on the lake ...  If they do, it will be a bad lookout for you,
old chap, a bad lookout! ...  I won't answer for anything."""
175,21,39,Again he puffed and blew like a walrus.
175,21,40,"""I won't answer for anything! ... If Erik's secrets cease to be Erik's
secrets, IT WILL BE A BAD LOOKOUT FOR A GOODLY NUMBER OF THE HUMAN
RACE!  That's all I have to tell you, and unless you are a great booby,
it ought to be enough for you ... except that you don't know how to
take a hint."""
175,21,41,"He had sat down on the stern of his boat and was kicking his heels
against the planks, waiting to hear what I had to answer.  I simply
said:"
175,21,42,"""It's not Erik that I'm after here!"""
175,21,43,"""Who then?"""
175,21,44,"""You know as well as I do:  it's Christine Daae,"" I answered."
175,21,45,"He retorted:  ""I have every right to see her in my own house.  I am
loved for my own sake."""
175,21,46,"""That's not true,"" I said.  ""You have carried her off and are keeping
her locked up."""
175,21,47,"""Listen,"" he said.  ""Will you promise never to meddle with my affairs
again, if I prove to you that I am loved for my own sake?"""
175,21,48,"""Yes, I promise you,"" I replied, without hesitation, for I felt
convinced that for such a monster the proof was impossible."
175,21,49,"""Well, then, it's quite simple ...  Christine Daae shall leave this as
she pleases and come back again! ... Yes, come back again, because she
wishes ... come back of herself, because she loves me for myself! ..."""
175,21,50,"""Oh, I doubt if she will come back! ... But it is your duty to let her
go.""  ""My duty, you great booby! ... It is my wish ...  my wish to let
her go; and she will come back again ... for she loves me! ... All this
will end in a marriage ... a marriage at the Madeleine, you great
booby!  Do you believe me now?  When I tell you that my nuptial mass is
written ... wait till you hear the KYRIE..."""
175,21,51,He beat time with his heels on the planks of the boat and sang:
175,21,52,"""KYRIE! ... KYRIE! ... KYRIE ELEISON! ... Wait till you hear, wait till
you hear that mass."""
175,21,53,"""Look here,"" I said.  ""I shall believe you if I see Christine Daae come
out of the house on the lake and go back to it of her own accord."""
175,21,54,"""And you won't meddle any more in my affairs?"""
175,21,55,"""No."""
175,21,56,"""Very well, you shall see that to - night. Come to the masked ball.
Christine and I will go and have a look round.  Then you can hide in
the lumber - room and you shall see Christine, who will have gone to her
dressing - room, delighted to come back by the Communists' road... And,
now, be off, for I must go and do some shopping!"""
175,21,57,"To my intense astonishment, things happened as he had announced.
Christine Daae left the house on the lake and returned to it several
times, without, apparently, being forced to do so.  It was very
difficult for me to clear my mind of Erik.  However, I resolved to be
extremely prudent, and did not make the mistake of returning to the
shore of the lake, or of going by the Communists' road.  But the idea
of the secret entrance in the third cellar haunted me, and I repeatedly
went and waited for hours behind a scene from the Roi de Lahore, which
had been left there for some reason or other.  At last my patience was
rewarded.  One day, I saw the monster come toward me, on his knees.  I
was certain that he could not see me.  He passed between the scene
behind which I stood and a set piece, went to the wall and pressed on a
spring that moved a stone and afforded him an ingress.  He passed
through this, and the stone closed behind him."
175,21,58,"I waited for at least thirty minutes and then pressed the spring in my
turn.  Everything happened as with Erik.  But I was careful not to go
through the hole myself, for I knew that Erik was inside.  On the other
hand, the idea that I might be caught by Erik suddenly made me think of
the death of Joseph Buquet.  I did not wish to jeopardize the
advantages of so great a discovery which might be useful to many
people, ""to a goodly number of the human race,"" in Erik's words; and I
left the cellars of the Opera after carefully replacing the stone."
175,21,59,"I continued to be greatly interested in the relations between Erik and
Christine Daae, not from any morbid curiosity, but because of the
terrible thought which obsessed my mind that Erik was capable of
anything, if he once discovered that he was not loved for his own sake,
as he imagined.  I continued to wander, very cautiously, about the
Opera and soon learned the truth about the monster's dreary love - affair."
175,21,60,"He filled Christine's mind, through the terror with which he inspired
her, but the dear child's heart belonged wholly to the Vicomte Raoul de
Chagny.  While they played about, like an innocent engaged couple, on
the upper floors of the Opera, to avoid the monster, they little
suspected that some one was watching over them.  I was prepared to do
anything:  to kill the monster, if necessary, and explain to the police
afterward.  But Erik did not show himself; and I felt none the more
comfortable for that."
175,21,61,"I must explain my whole plan.  I thought that the monster, being driven
from his house by jealousy, would thus enable me to enter it, without
danger, through the passage in the third cellar.  It was important, for
everybody's sake, that I should know exactly what was inside.  One day,
tired of waiting for an opportunity, I moved the stone and at once
heard an astounding music: the monster was working at his Don Juan
Triumphant, with every door in his house wide open.  I knew that this
was the work of his life.  I was careful not to stir and remained
prudently in my dark hole."
175,21,62,"He stopped playing, for a moment, and began walking about his place,
like a madman.  And he said aloud, at the top of his voice:"
175,21,63,"""It must be finished FIRST!  Quite finished!"""
175,21,64,"This speech was not calculated to reassure me and, when the music
recommenced, I closed the stone very softly."
175,21,65,"On the day of the abduction of Christine Daae, I did not come to the
theater until rather late in the evening, trembling lest I should hear
bad news.  I had spent a horrible day, for, after reading in a morning
paper the announcement of a forthcoming marriage between Christine and
the Vicomte de Chagny, I wondered whether, after all, I should not do
better to denounce the monster.  But reason returned to me, and I was
persuaded that this action could only precipitate a possible
catastrophe."
175,21,66,"When, my cab set me down before the Opera, I was really almost
astonished to see it still standing!  But I am something of a fatalist,
like all good Orientals, and I entered ready, for anything."
175,21,67,"Christine Daae's abduction in the Prison Act, which naturally surprised
everybody, found me prepared.  I was quite certain that she had been
juggled away by Erik, that prince of conjurers.  And I thought
positively that this was the end of Christine and perhaps of everybody,
so much so that I thought of advising all these people who were staying
on at the theater to make good their escape.  I felt, however, that
they would be sure to look upon me as mad and I refrained."
175,21,68,"On the other hand, I resolved to act without further delay, as far as I
was concerned.  The chances were in my favor that Erik, at that moment,
was thinking only of his captive.  This was the moment to enter his
house through the third cellar; and I resolved to take with me that
poor little desperate viscount, who, at the first suggestion, accepted,
with an amount of confidence in myself that touched me profoundly.  I
had sent my servant for my pistols.  I gave one to the viscount and
advised him to hold himself ready to fire, for, after all, Erik might
be waiting for us behind the wall.  We were to go by the Communists'
road and through the trap - door."
175,21,69,"Seeing my pistols, the little viscount asked me if we were going to
fight a duel.  I said:"
175,21,70,"""Yes; and what a duel!""  But, of course, I had no time to explain
anything to him.  The little viscount is a brave fellow, but he knew
hardly anything about his adversary; and it was so much the better.  My
great fear was that he was already somewhere near us, preparing the
Punjab lasso.  No one knows better than he how to throw the Punjab
lasso, for he is the king of stranglers even as he is the prince of
conjurors.  When he had finished making the little sultana laugh, at
the time of the ""rosy hours of Mazenderan,"" she herself used to ask him
to amuse her by giving her a thrill.  It was then that he introduced
the sport of the Punjab lasso."
175,21,71,"He had lived in India and acquired an incredible skill in the art of
strangulation.  He would make them lock him into a courtyard to which
they brought a warrior -  - usually, a man condemned to death -  - armed with a
long pike and broadsword.  Erik had only his lasso; and it was always
just when the warrior thought that he was going to fell Erik with a
tremendous blow that we heard the lasso whistle through the air.  With
a turn of the wrist, Erik tightened the noose round his adversary's
neck and, in this fashion, dragged him before the little sultana and
her women, who sat looking from a window and applauding.  The little
sultana herself learned to wield the Punjab lasso and killed several of
her women and even of the friends who visited her.  But I prefer to
drop this terrible subject of the rosy hours of Mazenderan.  I have
mentioned it only to explain why, on arriving with the Vicomte de
Chagny in the cellars of the Opera, I was bound to protect my companion
against the ever - threatening danger of death by strangling.  My pistols
could serve no purpose, for Erik was not likely to show himself; but
Erik could always strangle us.  I had no time to explain all this to
the viscount; besides, there was nothing to be gained by complicating
the position.  I simply told M. de Chagny to keep his hand at the level
of his eyes, with the arm bent, as though waiting for the command to
fire.  With his victim in this attitude, it is impossible even for the
most expert strangler to throw the lasso with advantage.  It catches
you not only round the neck, but also round the arm or hand.  This
enables you easily to unloose the lasso, which then becomes harmless."
175,21,72,"After avoiding the commissary of police, a number of door - shutters and
the firemen, after meeting the rat - catcher and passing the man in the
felt hat unperceived, the viscount and I arrived without obstacle in
the third cellar, between the set piece and the scene from the Roi de
Lahore.  I worked the stone, and we jumped into the house which Erik
had built himself in the double case of the foundation - walls of the
Opera.  And this was the easiest thing in the world for him to do,
because Erik was one of the chief contractors under Philippe Garnier,
the architect of the Opera, and continued to work by himself when the
works were officially suspended, during the war, the siege of Paris and
the Commune."
175,21,73,"I knew my Erik too well to feel at all comfortable on jumping into his
house.  I knew what he had made of a certain palace at Mazenderan.
From being the most honest building conceivable, he soon turned it into
a house of the very devil, where you could not utter a word but it was
overheard or repeated by an echo.  With his trap - doors the monster was
responsible for endless tragedies of all kinds.  He hit upon
astonishing inventions.  Of these, the most curious, horrible and
dangerous was the so - called torture - chamber. Except in special cases,
when the little sultana amused herself by inflicting suffering upon
some unoffending citizen, no one was let into it but wretches condemned
to death.  And, even then, when these had ""had enough,"" they were
always at liberty to put an end to themselves with a Punjab lasso or
bowstring, left for their use at the foot of an iron tree."
175,21,74,"My alarm, therefore, was great when I saw that the room into which M.
le Vicomte de Chagny and I had dropped was an exact copy of the
torture - chamber of the rosy hours of Mazenderan.  At our feet, I found
the Punjab lasso which I had been dreading all the evening.  I was
convinced that this rope had already done duty for Joseph Buquet, who,
like myself, must have caught Erik one evening working the stone in the
third cellar.  He probably tried it in his turn, fell into the
torture - chamber and only left it hanged.  I can well imagine Erik
dragging the body, in order to get rid of it, to the scene from the Roi
de Lahore, and hanging it there as an example, or to increase the
superstitious terror that was to help him in guarding the approaches to
his lair!  Then, upon reflection, Erik went back to fetch the Punjab
lasso, which is very curiously made out of catgut, and which might have
set an examining magistrate thinking.  This explains the disappearance
of the rope."
175,21,75,"And now I discovered the lasso, at our feet, in the torture - chamber!
...  I am no coward, but a cold sweat covered my forehead as I moved
the little red disk of my lantern over the walls."
175,21,76,M. de Chagny noticed it and asked:
175,21,77,"""What is the matter, sir?"""
175,21,78,I made him a violent sign to be silent.
175,21,79,"[1] An official report from Tonkin, received in Paris at the end of
July, 1909, relates how the famous pirate chief De Tham was tracked,
together with his men, by our soldiers; and how all of them succeeded
in escaping, thanks to this trick of the reeds."
175,21,80,[2] DAROGA is Persian for chief of police.
175,21,81,"[3] The Persian might easily have admitted that Erik's fate also
interested himself, for he was well aware that, if the government of
Teheran had learned that Erik was still alive, it would have been all
up with the modest pension of the erstwhile daroga.  It is only fair,
however, to add that the Persian had a noble and generous heart; and I
do not doubt for a moment that the catastrophes which he feared for
others greatly occupied his mind.  His conduct, throughout this
business, proves it and is above all praise."
175,22,1,THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED
175,22,2,"We were in the middle of a little six - cornered room, the sides of which
were covered with mirrors from top to bottom.  In the corners, we could
clearly see the ""joins"" in the glasses, the segments intended to turn
on their gear; yes, I recognized them and I recognized the iron tree in
the corner, at the bottom of one of those segments ... the iron tree,
with its iron branch, for the hanged men."
175,22,3,"I seized my companion's arm:  the Vicomte de Chagny was all a - quiver,
eager to shout to his betrothed that he was bringing her help.  I
feared that he would not be able to contain himself."
175,22,4,"Suddenly, we heard a noise on our left.  It sounded at first like a
door opening and shutting in the next room; and then there was a dull
moan.  I clutched M. de Chagny's arm more firmly still; and then we
distinctly heard these words:"
175,22,5,"""You must make your choice!  The wedding mass or the requiem mass!"" I
recognized the voice of the monster."
175,22,6,"There was another moan, followed by a long silence."
175,22,7,"I was persuaded by now that the monster was unaware of our presence in
his house, for otherwise he would certainly have managed not to let us
hear him.  He would only have had to close the little invisible window
through which the torture - lovers look down into the torture - chamber.
Besides, I was certain that, if he had known of our presence, the
tortures would have begun at once."
175,22,8,"The important thing was not to let him know; and I dreaded nothing so
much as the impulsiveness of the Vicomte de Chagny, who wanted to rush
through the walls to Christine Daae, whose moans we continued to hear
at intervals."
175,22,9,"""The requiem mass is not at all gay,"" Erik's voice resumed, ""whereas
the wedding mass -  - you can take my word for it -  - is magnificent!  You
must take a resolution and know your own mind!  I can't go on living
like this, like a mole in a burrow!  Don Juan Triumphant is finished;
and now I want to live like everybody else.  I want to have a wife like
everybody else and to take her out on Sundays.  I have invented a mask
that makes me look like anybody.  People will not even turn round in
the streets.  You will be the happiest of women.  And we will sing, all
by ourselves, till we swoon away with delight.  You are crying!  You
are afraid of me!  And yet I am not really wicked.  Love me and you
shall see!  All I wanted was to be loved for myself.  If you loved me I
should be as gentle as a lamb; and you could do anything with me that
you pleased."""
175,22,10,"Soon the moans that accompanied this sort of love's litany increased
and increased.  I have never heard anything more despairing; and M. de
Chagny and I recognized that this terrible lamentation came from Erik
himself.  Christine seemed to be standing dumb with horror, without the
strength to cry out, while the monster was on his knees before her."
175,22,11,"Three times over, Erik fiercely bewailed his fate:"
175,22,12,"""You don't love me!  You don't love me!  You don't love me!"""
175,22,13,"And then, more gently:"
175,22,14,"""Why do you cry?  You know it gives me pain to see you cry!"""
175,22,15,A silence.
175,22,16,Each silence gave us fresh hope.  We said to ourselves:
175,22,17,"""Perhaps he has left Christine behind the wall."""
175,22,18,"And we thought only of the possibility of warning Christine Daae of our
presence, unknown to the monster.  We were unable to leave the
torture - chamber now, unless Christine opened the door to us; and it was
only on this condition that we could hope to help her, for we did not
even know where the door might be."
175,22,19,"Suddenly, the silence in the next room was disturbed by the ringing of
an electric bell.  There was a bound on the other side of the wall and
Erik's voice of thunder:"
175,22,20,"""Somebody ringing!  Walk in, please!"""
175,22,21,A sinister chuckle.
175,22,22,"""Who has come bothering now?  Wait for me here ...  I AM GOING TO TELL
THE SIREN TO OPEN THE DOOR."""
175,22,23,"Steps moved away, a door closed.  I had no time to think of the fresh
horror that was preparing; I forgot that the monster was only going out
perhaps to perpetrate a fresh crime; I understood but one thing:
Christine was alone behind the wall!"
175,22,24,The Vicomte de Chagny was already calling to her:
175,22,25,"""Christine!  Christine!"""
175,22,26,"As we could hear what was said in the next room, there was no reason
why my companion should not be heard in his turn.  Nevertheless, the
viscount had to repeat his cry time after time."
175,22,27,"At last, a faint voice reached us."
175,22,28,"""I am dreaming!"" it said."
175,22,29,"""Christine, Christine, it is I, Raoul!"""
175,22,30,A silence.
175,22,31,"""But answer me, Christine! ... In Heaven's name, if you are alone,
answer me!"""
175,22,32,Then Christine's voice whispered Raoul's name.
175,22,33,"""Yes!  Yes!  It is I!  It is not a dream! ... Christine, trust me! ...
We are here to save you ... but be prudent!  When you hear the monster,
warn us!"""
175,22,34,"Then Christine gave way to fear.  She trembled lest Erik should
discover where Raoul was hidden; she told us in a few hurried words
that Erik had gone quite mad with love and that he had decided TO KILL
EVERYBODY AND HIMSELF WITH EVERYBODY if she did not consent to become
his wife.  He had given her till eleven o'clock the next evening for
reflection.  It was the last respite.  She must choose, as he said,
between the wedding mass and the requiem."
175,22,35,"And Erik had then uttered a phrase which Christine did not quite
understand:"
175,22,36,"""Yes or no!  If your answer is no, everybody will be dead AND BURIED!"""
175,22,37,"But I understood the sentence perfectly, for it corresponded in a
terrible manner with my own dreadful thought."
175,22,38,"""Can you tell us where Erik is?""  I asked."
175,22,39,She replied that he must have left the house.
175,22,40,"""Could you make sure?"""
175,22,41,"""No. I am fastened.  I can not stir a limb."""
175,22,42,"When we heard this, M. de Chagny and I gave a yell of fury.  Our
safety, the safety of all three of us, depended on the girl's liberty
of movement."
175,22,43,"""But where are you?"" asked Christine.  ""There are only two doors in my
room, the Louis - Philippe room of which I told you, Raoul; a door
through which Erik comes and goes, and another which he has never
opened before me and which he has forbidden me ever to go through,
because he says it is the most dangerous of the doors, the door of the
torture - chamber!"""
175,22,44,"""Christine, that is where we are!"""
175,22,45,"""You are in the torture - chamber?"""
175,22,46,"""Yes, but we can not see the door."""
175,22,47,"""Oh, if I could only drag myself so far!  I would knock at the door and
that would tell you where it is."""
175,22,48,"""Is it a door with a lock to it?""  I asked."
175,22,49,"""Yes, with a lock."""
175,22,50,"""Mademoiselle,"" I said, ""it is absolutely necessary, that you should
open that door to us!"""
175,22,51,"""But how?"" asked the poor girl tearfully."
175,22,52,"We heard her straining, trying to free herself from the bonds that held
her."
175,22,53,"""I know where the key is,"" she said, in a voice that seemed exhausted
by the effort she had made.  ""But I am fastened so tight ...  Oh, the
wretch!"""
175,22,54,And she gave a sob.
175,22,55,"""Where is the key?""  I asked, signing to M. de Chagny not to speak and
to leave the business to me, for we had not a moment to lose."
175,22,56,"""In the next room, near the organ, with another little bronze key,
which he also forbade me to touch.  They are both in a little leather
bag which he calls the bag of life and death...  Raoul!  Raoul!  Fly!
Everything is mysterious and terrible here, and Erik will soon have
gone quite mad, and you are in the torture - chamber! ... Go back by the
way you came.  There must be a reason why the room is called by that
name!"""
175,22,57,"""Christine,"" said the young man.  ""We will go from here together or die
together!"""
175,22,58,"""We must keep cool,"" I whispered.  ""Why has he fastened you,
mademoiselle?  You can't escape from his house; and he knows it!"""
175,22,59,"""I tried to commit suicide!  The monster went out last night, after
carrying me here fainting and half chloroformed.  He was going TO HIS
BANKER, so he said! ... When he returned he found me with my face
covered with blood ...  I had tried to kill myself by striking my
forehead against the walls."""
175,22,60,"""Christine!"" groaned Raoul; and he began to sob."
175,22,61,"""Then he bound me ...  I am not allowed to die until eleven o'clock
to - morrow evening."""
175,22,62,"""Mademoiselle,"" I declared, ""the monster bound you ... and he shall
unbind you.  You have only to play the necessary part!  Remember that
he loves you!"""
175,22,63,"""Alas!"" we heard.  ""Am I likely to forget it!"""
175,22,64,"""Remember it and smile to him ... entreat him ... tell him that your
bonds hurt you."""
175,22,65,But Christine Daae said:
175,22,66,"""Hush! ... I hear something in the wall on the lake! ... It is he! ...
Go away!  Go away!  Go away!"""
175,22,67,"""We could not go away, even if we wanted to,"" I said, as impressively
as I could.  ""We can not leave this!  And we are in the
torture - chamber!"""
175,22,68,"""Hush!"" whispered Christine again."
175,22,69,"Heavy steps sounded slowly behind the wall, then stopped and made the
floor creak once more.  Next came a tremendous sigh, followed by a cry
of horror from Christine, and we heard Erik's voice:"
175,22,70,"""I beg your pardon for letting you see a face like this!  What a state
I am in, am I not?  It's THE OTHER ONE'S FAULT!  Why did he ring?  Do I
ask people who pass to tell me the time?  He will never ask anybody the
time again!  It is the siren's fault."""
175,22,71,[Illustration: two page color illustration]
175,22,72,"Another sigh, deeper, more tremendous still, came from the abysmal
depths of a soul."
175,22,73,"""Why did you cry out, Christine?"""
175,22,74,"""Because I am in pain, Erik."""
175,22,75,"""I thought I had frightened you."""
175,22,76,"""Erik, unloose my bonds ...  Am I not your prisoner?"""
175,22,77,"""You will try to kill yourself again."""
175,22,78,"""You have given me till eleven o'clock to - morrow evening, Erik."""
175,22,79,The footsteps dragged along the floor again.
175,22,80,"""After all, as we are to die together ... and I am just as eager as you
... yes, I have had enough of this life, you know...  Wait, don't move,
I will release you ...  You have only one word to say:  'NO!' And it
will at once be over WITH EVERYBODY!  ... You are right, you are right;
why wait till eleven o'clock to - morrow evening?  True, it would have
been grander, finer ...  But that is childish nonsense ...  We should
only think of ourselves in this life, of our own death ... the rest
doesn't matter...  YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME BECAUSE I AM ALL WET? ...  Oh,
my dear, it's raining cats and dogs outside! ... Apart from that,
Christine, I think I am subject to hallucinations ...  You know, the
man who rang at the siren's door just now -  - go and look if he's ringing
at the bottom of the lake - well, he was rather like...  There, turn
round ... are you glad?  You're free now...  Oh, my poor Christine,
look at your wrists:  tell me, have I hurt them? ... That alone
deserves death ...  Talking of death, I MUST SING HIS REQUIEM!"""
175,22,81,"Hearing these terrible remarks, I received an awful presentiment ... I
too had once rung at the monster's door ... and, without knowing it,
must have set some warning current in motion."
175,22,82,"And I remembered the two arms that had emerged from the inky waters...
What poor wretch had strayed to that shore this time?  Who was 'the
other one,' the one whose requiem we now heard sung?"
175,22,83,"Erik sang like the god of thunder, sang a DIES IRAE that enveloped us
as in a storm.  The elements seemed to rage around us.  Suddenly, the
organ and the voice ceased so suddenly that M. de Chagny sprang back,
on the other side of the wall, with emotion.  And the voice, changed
and transformed, distinctly grated out these metallic syllables: ""WHAT
HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY BAG?"""
175,23,1,THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED.
175,23,2,"The voice repeated angrily:  ""What have you done with my bag?  So it
was to take my bag that you asked me to release you!"""
175,23,3,"We heard hurried steps, Christine running back to the Louis - Philippe
room, as though to seek shelter on the other side of our wall."
175,23,4,"""What are you running away for?"" asked the furious voice, which had
followed her.  ""Give me back my bag, will you?  Don't you know that it
is the bag of life and death?"""
175,23,5,"""Listen to me, Erik,"" sighed the girl.  ""As it is settled that we are
to live together ... what difference can it make to you?"""
175,23,6,"""You know there are only two keys in it,"" said the monster.  ""What do
you want to do?"""
175,23,7,"""I want to look at this room which I have never seen and which you have
always kept from me ...  It's woman's curiosity!"" she said, in a tone
which she tried to render playful."
175,23,8,But the trick was too childish for Erik to be taken in by it.
175,23,9,"""I don't like curious women,"" he retorted, ""and you had better remember
the story of BLUE - BEARD and be careful ...  Come, give me back my bag!
... Give me back my bag! ... Leave the key alone, will you, you
inquisitive little thing?"""
175,23,10,"And he chuckled, while Christine gave a cry of pain.  Erik had
evidently recovered the bag from her."
175,23,11,"At that moment, the viscount could not help uttering an exclamation of
impotent rage."
175,23,12,"""Why, what's that?"" said the monster.  ""Did you hear, Christine?"""
175,23,13,"""No, no,"" replied the poor girl.  ""I heard nothing."""
175,23,14,"""I thought I heard a cry."""
175,23,15,"""A cry!  Are you going mad, Erik?  Whom do you expect to give a cry, in
this house? ... I cried out, because you hurt me!  I heard nothing."""
175,23,16,"""I don't like the way you said that! ... You're trembling...  You're
quite excited ...  You're lying! ... That was a cry, there was a cry!
... There is some one in the torture - chamber! ...  Ah, I understand
now!"""
175,23,17,"""There is no one there, Erik!"""
175,23,18,"""I understand!"""
175,23,19,"""No one!"""
175,23,20,"""The man you want to marry, perhaps!"""
175,23,21,"""I don't want to marry anybody, you know I don't."""
175,23,22,"Another nasty chuckle.  ""Well, it won't take long to find out.
Christine, my love, we need not open the door to see what is happening
in the torture - chamber. Would you like to see?  Would you like to see?
Look here!  If there is some one, if there is really some one there,
you will see the invisible window light up at the top, near the
ceiling.  We need only draw the black curtain and put out the light in
here.  There, that's it ...  Let's put out the light!  You're not
afraid of the dark, when you're with your little husband!"""
175,23,23,Then we heard Christine's voice of anguish:
175,23,24,"""No! ... I'm frightened! ... I tell you, I'm afraid of the dark! ...  I
don't care about that room now ...  You're always frightening me, like
a child, with your torture - chamber! ... And so I became inquisitive...
But I don't care about it now ... not a bit ... not a bit!"""
175,23,25,"And that which I feared above all things began, AUTOMATICALLY.  We were
suddenly flooded with light!  Yes, on our side of the wall, everything
seemed aglow.  The Vicomte de Chagny was so much taken aback that he
staggered.  And the angry voice roared:"
175,23,26,"""I told you there was some one!  Do you see the window now?  The
lighted window, right up there?  The man behind the wall can't see it!
But you shall go up the folding steps:  that is what they are there
for! ... You have often asked me to tell you; and now you know! ...
They are there to give a peep into the torture - chamber ... you
inquisitive little thing!"""
175,23,27,"""What tortures? ... Who is being tortured? ... Erik, Erik, say you are
only trying to frighten me! ... Say it, if you love me, Erik! ... There
are no tortures, are there?"""
175,23,28,"""Go and look at the little window, dear!"""
175,23,29,"I do not know if the viscount heard the girl's swooning voice, for he
was too much occupied by the astounding spectacle that now appeared
before his distracted gaze.  As for me, I had seen that sight too
often, through the little window, at the time of the rosy hours of
Mazenderan; and I cared only for what was being said next door, seeking
for a hint how to act, what resolution to take."
175,23,30,"""Go and peep through the little window!  Tell me what he looks like!"""
175,23,31,We heard the steps being dragged against the wall.
175,23,32,"""Up with you! ... No! ... No, I will go up myself, dear!"""
175,23,33,"""Oh, very well, I will go up.  Let me go!"""
175,23,34,"""Oh, my darling, my darling! ... How sweet of you! ... How nice of you
to save me the exertion at my age! ... Tell me what he looks like!"""
175,23,35,"At that moment, we distinctly heard these words above our heads:"
175,23,36,"""There is no one there, dear!"""
175,23,37,"""No one? ... Are you sure there is no one?"""
175,23,38,"""Why, of course not ... no one!"""
175,23,39,"""Well, that's all right! ... What's the matter, Christine?  You're not
going to faint, are you ... as there is no one there? ...  Here ...
come down ... there! ... Pull yourself together ... as there is no one
there! ... BUT HOW DO YOU LIKE THE LANDSCAPE?"""
175,23,40,"""Oh, very much!"""
175,23,41,"""There, that's better! ... You're better now, are you not? ...  That's
all right, you're better! ... No excitement! ... And what a funny
house, isn't it, with landscapes like that in it?"""
175,23,42,"""Yes, it's like the Musee Grevin ...  But, say, Erik ... there are no
tortures in there! ... What a fright you gave me!"""
175,23,43,"""Why ... as there is no one there?"""
175,23,44,"""Did you design that room?  It's very handsome.  You're a great artist,
Erik."""
175,23,45,"""Yes, a great artist, in my own line."""
175,23,46,"""But tell me, Erik, why did you call that room the torture - chamber?"""
175,23,47,"""Oh, it's very simple.  First of all, what did you see?"""
175,23,48,"""I saw a forest."""
175,23,49,"""And what is in a forest?"""
175,23,50,"""Trees."""
175,23,51,"""And what is in a tree?"""
175,23,52,"""Birds."""
175,23,53,"""Did you see any birds?"""
175,23,54,"""No, I did not see any birds."""
175,23,55,"""Well, what did you see?  Think!  You saw branches And what are the
branches?"" asked the terrible voice.  ""THERE'S A GIBBET!  That is why I
call my wood the torture - chamber! ... You see, it's all a joke.  I
never express myself like other people.  But I am very tired of it! ...
I'm sick and tired of having a forest and a torture - chamber in my house
and of living like a mountebank, in a house with a false bottom! ...
I'm tired of it!  I want to have a nice, quiet flat, with ordinary
doors and windows and a wife inside it, like anybody else!  A wife whom
I could love and take out on Sundays and keep amused on week - days ...
Here, shall I show you some card - tricks? That will help us to pass a
few minutes, while waiting for eleven o'clock to - morrow evening ...  My
dear little Christine! ... Are you listening to me? ... Tell me you
love me! ...  No, you don't love me ... but no matter, you will! ...
Once, you could not look at my mask because you knew what was behind...
And now you don't mind looking at it and you forget what is behind! ...
One can get used to everything ... if one wishes...  Plenty of young
people who did not care for each other before marriage have adored each
other since!  Oh, I don't know what I am talking about!  But you would
have lots of fun with me.  For instance, I am the greatest
ventriloquist that ever lived, I am the first ventriloquist in the
world! ... You're laughing ...  Perhaps you don't believe me?  Listen."""
175,23,56,"The wretch, who really was the first ventriloquist in the world, was
only trying to divert the child's attention from the torture - chamber;
but it was a stupid scheme, for Christine thought of nothing but us!
She repeatedly besought him, in the gentlest tones which she could
assume:"
175,23,57,"""Put out the light in the little window! ... Erik, do put out the light
in the little window!"""
175,23,58,"For she saw that this light, which appeared so suddenly and of which
the monster had spoken in so threatening a voice, must mean something
terrible.  One thing must have pacified her for a moment; and that was
seeing the two of us, behind the wall, in the midst of that resplendent
light, alive and well.  But she would certainly have felt much easier
if the light had been put out."
175,23,59,"Meantime, the other had already begun to play the ventriloquist.  He
said:"
175,23,60,"""Here, I raise my mask a little ...  Oh, only a little! ...  You see my
lips, such lips as I have?  They're not moving! ... My mouth is
closed -  - such mouth as I have -  - and yet you hear my voice... Where will
you have it?  In your left ear?  In your right ear?  In the table?  In
those little ebony boxes on the mantelpiece? ...  Listen, dear, it's in
the little box on the right of the mantelpiece: what does it say?
'SHALL I TURN THE SCORPION?' ... And now, crack!  What does it say in
the little box on the left?  'SHALL I TURN THE GRASSHOPPER?' ... And
now, crack!  Here it is in the little leather bag ...  What does it
say?  'I AM THE LITTLE BAG OF LIFE AND DEATH!' ...  And now, crack!  It
is in Carlotta's throat, in Carlotta's golden throat, in Carlotta's
crystal throat, as I live!  What does it say?  It says, 'It's I, Mr.
Toad, it's I singing!  I FEEL WITHOUT ALARM -  - CO - ACK -  - WITH ITS MELODY
ENWIND ME -  - CO - ACK!' ...  And now, crack!  It is on a chair in the
ghost's box and it says, 'MADAME CARLOTTA IS SINGING TO - NIGHT TO BRING
THE CHANDELIER DOWN!' ... And now, crack!  Aha!  Where is Erik's voice
now?  Listen, Christine, darling!  Listen!  It is behind the door of
the torture - chamber! Listen!  It's myself in the torture - chamber! And
what do I say?  I say, 'Woe to them that have a nose, a real nose, and
come to look round the torture - chamber! Aha, aha, aha!'"""
175,23,61,"Oh, the ventriloquist's terrible voice!  It was everywhere, everywhere.
It passed through the little invisible window, through the walls.  It
ran around us, between us.  Erik was there, speaking to us!  We made a
movement as though to fling ourselves upon him.  But, already, swifter,
more fleeting than the voice of the echo, Erik's voice had leaped back
behind the wall!"
175,23,62,"Soon we heard nothing more at all, for this is what happened:"
175,23,63,"""Erik!  Erik!"" said Christine's voice.  ""You tire me with your voice.
Don't go on, Erik!  Isn't it very hot here?"""
175,23,64,"""Oh, yes,"" replied Erik's voice, ""the heat is unendurable!"""
175,23,65,"""But what does this mean? ... The wall is really getting quite hot! ...
The wall is burning!"""
175,23,66,"""I'll tell you, Christine, dear:  it is because of the forest next
door."""
175,23,67,"""Well, what has that to do with it?  The forest?"""
175,23,68,"""WHY, DIDN'T YOU SEE THAT IT WAS AN AFRICAN FOREST?"""
175,23,69,"And the monster laughed so loudly and hideously that we could no longer
distinguish Christine's supplicating cries!  The Vicomte de Chagny
shouted and banged against the walls like a madman.  I could not
restrain him.  But we heard nothing except the monster's laughter, and
the monster himself can have heard nothing else.  And then there was
the sound of a body falling on the floor and being dragged along and a
door slammed and then nothing, nothing more around us save the
scorching silence of the south in the heart of a tropical forest!"
175,24,1,THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED
175,24,2,"I have said that the room in which M. le Vicomte de Chagny and I were
imprisoned was a regular hexagon, lined entirely with mirrors.  Plenty
of these rooms have been seen since, mainly at exhibitions: they are
called ""palaces of illusion,"" or some such name.  But the invention
belongs entirely to Erik, who built the first room of this kind under
my eyes, at the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan.  A decorative
object, such as a column, for instance, was placed in one of the
corners and immediately produced a hall of a thousand columns; for,
thanks to the mirrors, the real room was multiplied by six hexagonal
rooms, each of which, in its turn, was multiplied indefinitely.  But
the little sultana soon tired of this infantile illusion, whereupon
Erik altered his invention into a ""torture - chamber."" For the
architectural motive placed in one corner, he substituted an iron tree.
This tree, with its painted leaves, was absolutely true to life and was
made of iron so as to resist all the attacks of the ""patient"" who was
locked into the torture - chamber.  We shall see how the scene thus
obtained was twice altered instantaneously into two successive other
scenes, by means of the automatic rotation of the drums or rollers in
the corners.  These were divided into three sections, fitting into the
angles of the mirrors and each supporting a decorative scheme that came
into sight as the roller revolved upon its axis."
175,24,3,"The walls of this strange room gave the patient nothing to lay hold of,
because, apart from the solid decorative object, they were simply
furnished with mirrors, thick enough to withstand any onslaught of the
victim, who was flung into the chamber empty - handed and barefoot."
175,24,4,"There was no furniture.  The ceiling was capable of being lit up.  An
ingenious system of electric heating, which has since been imitated,
allowed the temperature of the walls and room to be increased at will."
175,24,5,"I am giving all these details of a perfectly natural invention,
producing, with a few painted branches, the supernatural illusion of an
equatorial forest blazing under the tropical sun, so that no one may
doubt the present balance of my brain or feel entitled to say that I am
mad or lying or that I take him for a fool.[1]"
175,24,6,"I now return to the facts where I left them.  When the ceiling lit up
and the forest became visible around us, the viscount's stupefaction
was immense.  That impenetrable forest, with its innumerable trunks and
branches, threw him into a terrible state of consternation.  He passed
his hands over his forehead, as though to drive away a dream; his eyes
blinked; and, for a moment, he forgot to listen."
175,24,7,"I have already said that the sight of the forest did not surprise me at
all; and therefore I listened for the two of us to what was happening
next door.  Lastly, my attention was especially attracted, not so much
to the scene, as to the mirrors that produced it.  These mirrors were
broken in parts.  Yes, they were marked and scratched; they had been
""starred,"" in spite of their solidity; and this proved to me that the
torture - chamber in which we now were HAD ALREADY SERVED A PURPOSE."
175,24,8,"Yes, some wretch, whose feet were not bare like those of the victims of
the rosy hours of Mazenderan, had certainly fallen into this ""mortal
illusion"" and, mad with rage, had kicked against those mirrors which,
nevertheless, continued to reflect his agony.  And the branch of the
tree on which he had put an end to his own sufferings was arranged in
such a way that, before dying, he had seen, for his last consolation, a
thousand men writhing in his company."
175,24,9,"Yes, Joseph Buquet had undoubtedly been through all this!  Were we to
die as he had done?  I did not think so, for I knew that we had a few
hours before us and that I could employ them to better purpose than
Joseph Buquet was able to do.  After all, I was thoroughly acquainted
with most of Erik's ""tricks;"" and now or never was the time to turn my
knowledge to account."
175,24,10,"To begin with, I gave up every idea of returning to the passage that
had brought us to that accursed chamber.  I did not trouble about the
possibility of working the inside stone that closed the passage; and
this for the simple reason that to do so was out of the question.  We
had dropped from too great a height into the torture - chamber; there was
no furniture to help us reach that passage; not even the branch of the
iron tree, not even each other's shoulders were of any avail."
175,24,11,"There was only one possible outlet, that opening into the
Louis - Philippe room in which Erik and Christine Daae were.  But, though
this outlet looked like an ordinary door on Christine's side, it was
absolutely invisible to us.  We must therefore try to open it without
even knowing where it was."
175,24,12,"When I was quite sure that there was no hope for us from Christine
Daae's side, when I had heard the monster dragging the poor girl from
the Louis - Philippe room LEST SHE SHOULD INTERFERE WITH OUR TORTURES, I
resolved to set to work without delay."
175,24,13,"But I had first to calm M. de Chagny, who was already walking about
like a madman, uttering incoherent cries.  The snatches of conversation
which he had caught between Christine and the monster had contributed
not a little to drive him beside himself: add to that the shock of the
magic forest and the scorching heat which was beginning to make the
prespiration{sic} stream down his temples and you will have no
difficulty in understanding his state of mind.  He shouted Christine's
name, brandished his pistol, knocked his forehead against the glass in
his endeavors to run down the glades of the illusive forest.  In short,
the torture was beginning to work its spell upon a brain unprepared for
it."
175,24,14,"I did my best to induce the poor viscount to listen to reason.  I made
him touch the mirrors and the iron tree and the branches and explained
to him, by optical laws, all the luminous imagery by which we were
surrounded and of which we need not allow ourselves to be the victims,
like ordinary, ignorant people."
175,24,15,"""We are in a room, a little room; that is what you must keep saying to
yourself.  And we shall leave the room as soon as we have found the
door."""
175,24,16,"And I promised him that, if he let me act, without disturbing me by
shouting and walking up and down, I would discover the trick of the
door in less than an hour's time."
175,24,17,"Then he lay flat on the floor, as one does in a wood, and declared that
he would wait until I found the door of the forest, as there was
nothing better to do!  And he added that, from where he was, ""the view
was splendid!""  The torture was working, in spite of all that I had
said."
175,24,18,"Myself, forgetting the forest, I tackled a glass panel and began to
finger it in every direction, hunting for the weak point on which to
press in order to turn the door in accordance with Erik's system of
pivots.  This weak point might be a mere speck on the glass, no larger
than a pea, under which the spring lay hidden.  I hunted and hunted.  I
felt as high as my hands could reach.  Erik was about the same height
as myself and I thought that he would not have placed the spring higher
than suited his stature."
175,24,19,"While groping over the successive panels with the greatest care, I
endeavored not to lose a minute, for I was feeling more and more
overcome with the heat and we were literally roasting in that blazing
forest."
175,24,20,"I had been working like this for half an hour and had finished three
panels, when, as ill - luck would have it, I turned round on hearing a
muttered exclamation from the viscount."
175,24,21,"""I am stifling,"" he said.  ""All those mirrors are sending out an
infernal heat!  Do you think you will find that spring soon?  If you
are much longer about it, we shall be roasted alive!"""
175,24,22,"I was not sorry to hear him talk like this.  He had not said a word of
the forest and I hoped that my companion's reason would hold out some
time longer against the torture.  But he added:"
175,24,23,"""What consoles me is that the monster has given Christine until eleven
to - morrow evening.  If we can't get out of here and go to her
assistance, at least we shall be dead before her!  Then Erik's mass can
serve for all of us!"""
175,24,24,And he gulped down a breath of hot air that nearly made him faint.
175,24,25,"As I had not the same desperate reasons as M. le Vicomte for accepting
death, I returned, after giving him a word of encouragement, to my
panel, but I had made the mistake of taking a few steps while speaking
and, in the tangle of the illusive forest, I was no longer able to find
my panel for certain!  I had to begin all over again, at random,
feeling, fumbling, groping."
175,24,26,"Now the fever laid hold of me in my turn ... for I found nothing,
absolutely nothing.  In the next room, all was silence.  We were quite
lost in the forest, without an outlet, a compass, a guide or anything.
Oh, I knew what awaited us if nobody came to our aid ...  or if I did
not find the spring!  But, look as I might, I found nothing but
branches, beautiful branches that stood straight up before me, or
spread gracefully over my head.  But they gave no shade.  And this was
natural enough, as we were in an equatorial forest, with the sun right
above our heads, an African forest."
175,24,27,"M. de Chagny and I had repeatedly taken off our coats and put them on
again, finding at one time that they made us feel still hotter and at
another that they protected us against the heat.  I was still making a
moral resistance, but M. de Chagny seemed to me quite ""gone."" He
pretended that he had been walking in that forest for three days and
nights, without stopping, looking for Christine Daae!  From time to
time, he thought he saw her behind the trunk of a tree, or gliding
between the branches; and he called to her with words of supplication
that brought the tears to my eyes.  And then, at last:"
175,24,28,"""Oh, how thirsty I am!"" he cried, in delirious accents."
175,24,29,"I too was thirsty.  My throat was on fire.  And, yet, squatting on the
floor, I went on hunting, hunting, hunting for the spring of the
invisible door ... especially as it was dangerous to remain in the
forest as evening drew nigh.  Already the shades of night were
beginning to surround us.  It had happened very quickly: night falls
quickly in tropical countries ... suddenly, with hardly any twilight."
175,24,30,"Now night, in the forests of the equator, is always dangerous,
particularly when, like ourselves, one has not the materials for a fire
to keep off the beasts of prey.  I did indeed try for a moment to break
off the branches, which I would have lit with my dark lantern, but I
knocked myself also against the mirrors and remembered, in time, that
we had only images of branches to do with."
175,24,31,"The heat did not go with the daylight; on the contrary, it was now
still hotter under the blue rays of the moon.  I urged the viscount to
hold our weapons ready to fire and not to stray from camp, while I went
on looking for my spring."
175,24,32,"Suddenly, we heard a lion roaring a few yards away."
175,24,33,"""Oh,"" whispered the viscount, ""he is quite close! ... Don't you see
him? ... There ... through the trees ... in that thicket!  If he roars
again, I will fire! ..."""
175,24,34,"And the roaring began again, louder than before.  And the viscount
fired, but I do not think that he hit the lion; only, he smashed a
mirror, as I perceived the next morning, at daybreak.  We must have
covered a good distance during the night, for we suddenly found
ourselves on the edge of the desert, an immense desert of sand, stones
and rocks.  It was really not worth while leaving the forest to come
upon the desert.  Tired out, I flung myself down beside the viscount,
for I had had enough of looking for springs which I could not find."
175,24,35,"I was quite surprised -  - and I said so to the viscount -  - that we had
encountered no other dangerous animals during the night.  Usually,
after the lion came the leopard and sometimes the buzz of the tsetse
fly.  These were easily obtained effects; and I explained to M. de
Chagny that Erik imitated the roar of a lion on a long tabour or
timbrel, with an ass's skin at one end.  Over this skin he tied a
string of catgut, which was fastened at the middle to another similar
string passing through the whole length of the tabour.  Erik had only
to rub this string with a glove smeared with resin and, according to
the manner in which he rubbed it, he imitated to perfection the voice
of the lion or the leopard, or even the buzzing of the tsetse fly."
175,24,36,"The idea that Erik was probably in the room beside us, working his
trick, made me suddenly resolve to enter into a parley with him, for we
must obviously give up all thought of taking him by surprise.  And by
this time he must be quite aware who were the occupants of his
torture - chamber. I called him:  ""Erik!  Erik!"""
175,24,37,"I shouted as loudly as I could across the desert, but there was no
answer to my voice.  All around us lay the silence and the bare
immensity of that stony desert.  What was to become of us in the midst
of that awful solitude?"
175,24,38,"We were beginning literally to die of heat, hunger and thirst ...  of
thirst especially.  At last, I saw M. de Chagny raise himself on his
elbow and point to a spot on the horizon.  He had discovered an oasis!"
175,24,39,"Yes, far in the distance was an oasis ... an oasis with limpid water,
which reflected the iron trees! ... Tush, it was the scene of the
mirage ...  I recognized it at once ... the worst of the three! ... No
one had been able to fight against it ... no one...  I did my utmost to
keep my head AND NOT TO HOPE FOR WATER, because I knew that, if a man
hoped for water, the water that reflected the iron tree, and if, after
hoping for water, he struck against the mirror, then there was only one
thing for him to do: to hang himself on the iron tree!"
175,24,40,So I cried to M. de Chagny:
175,24,41,"""It's the mirage! ... It's the mirage! ... Don't believe in the water!
... It's another trick of the mirrors! ..."""
175,24,42,"Then he flatly told me to shut up, with my tricks of the mirrors, my
springs, my revolving doors and my palaces of illusions!  He angrily
declared that I must be either blind or mad to imagine that all that
water flowing over there, among those splendid, numberless trees, was
not real water! ... And the desert was real!  ... And so was the
forest! ... And it was no use trying to take him in ... he was an old,
experienced traveler ... he had been all over the place!"
175,24,43,"And he dragged himself along, saying:  ""Water!  Water!"""
175,24,44,"And his mouth was open, as though he were drinking."
175,24,45,"And my mouth was open too, as though I were drinking."
175,24,46,"For we not only saw the water, but WE HEARD IT! ... We heard it flow,
we heard it ripple! ... Do you understand that word ""ripple?"" ... IT IS
A SOUND WHICH YOU HEAR WITH YOUR TONGUE!  ... You put your tongue out
of your mouth to listen to it better!"
175,24,47,"Lastly -  - and this was the most pitiless torture of all -  - we heard the
rain and it was not raining!  This was an infernal invention...  Oh, I
knew well enough how Erik obtained it!  He filled with little stones a
very long and narrow box, broken up inside with wooden and metal
projections.  The stones, in falling, struck against these projections
and rebounded from one to another; and the result was a series of
pattering sounds that exactly imitated a rainstorm."
175,24,48,"Ah, you should have seen us putting out our tongues and dragging
ourselves toward the rippling river - bank! Our eyes and ears were full
of water, but our tongues were hard and dry as horn!"
175,24,49,"When we reached the mirror, M. de Chagny licked it ... and I also
licked the glass."
175,24,50,It was burning hot!
175,24,51,"Then we rolled on the floor with a hoarse cry of despair.  M. de Chagny
put the one pistol that was still loaded to his temple; and I stared at
the Punjab lasso at the foot of the iron tree.  I knew why the iron
tree had returned, in this third change of scene! ...  The iron tree
was waiting for me! ..."
175,24,52,"But, as I stared at the Punjab lasso, I saw a thing that made me start
so violently that M. de Chagny delayed his attempt at suicide.  I took
his arm.  And then I caught the pistol from him ... and then I dragged
myself on my knees toward what I had seen."
175,24,53,"I had discovered, near the Punjab lasso, in a groove in the floor, a
black - headed nail of which I knew the use.  At last I had discovered
the spring!  I felt the nail ...  I lifted a radiant face to M. de
Chagny ...  The black - headed nail yielded to my pressure ..."
175,24,54,And then ...
175,24,55,"And then we saw not a door opened in the wall, but a cellar - flap
released in the floor.  Cool air came up to us from the black hole
below.  We stooped over that square of darkness as though over a limpid
well.  With our chins in the cool shade, we drank it in.  And we bent
lower and lower over the trap - door. What could there be in that cellar
which opened before us?  Water?  Water to drink?"
175,24,56,"I thrust my arm into the darkness and came upon a stone and another
stone ... a staircase ... a dark staircase leading into the cellar.
The viscount wanted to fling himself down the hole; but I, fearing a
new trick of the monster's, stopped him, turned on my dark lantern and
went down first."
175,24,57,"The staircase was a winding one and led down into pitchy darkness.  But
oh, how deliciously cool were the darkness and the stairs?  The lake
could not be far away."
175,24,58,"We soon reached the bottom.  Our eyes were beginning to accustom
themselves to the dark, to distinguish shapes around us ...  circular
shapes ... on which I turned the light of my lantern."
175,24,59,Barrels!
175,24,60,"We were in Erik's cellar:  it was here that he must keep his wine and
perhaps his drinking - water. I knew that Erik was a great lover of good
wine.  Ah, there was plenty to drink here!"
175,24,61,M. de Chagny patted the round shapes and kept on saying:
175,24,62,"""Barrels!  Barrels!  What a lot of barrels! ..."""
175,24,63,"Indeed, there was quite a number of them, symmetrically arranged in two
rows, one on either side of us.  They were small barrels and I thought
that Erik must have selected them of that size to facilitate their
carriage to the house on the lake."
175,24,64,"We examined them successively, to see if one of them had not a funnel,
showing that it had been tapped at some time or another.  But all the
barrels were hermetically closed."
175,24,65,"Then, after half lifting one to make sure it was full, we went on our
knees and, with the blade of a small knife which I carried, I prepared
to stave in the bung - hole."
175,24,66,"At that moment, I seemed to hear, coming from very far, a sort of
monotonous chant which I knew well, from often hearing it in the
streets of Paris:"
175,24,67,"""Barrels! ... Barrels! ... Any barrels to sell?"""
175,24,68,My hand desisted from its work.  M. de Chagny had also heard.  He said:
175,24,69,"""That's funny!  It sounds as if the barrel were singing!"""
175,24,70,"The song was renewed, farther away:"
175,24,71,"""Barrels! ... Barrels! ... Any barrels to sell? ..."""
175,24,72,"""Oh, I swear,"" said the viscount, ""that the tune dies away in the
barrel! ..."""
175,24,73,We stood up and went to look behind the barrel.
175,24,74,"""It's inside,"" said M. de Chagny, ""it's inside!"""
175,24,75,"But we heard nothing there and were driven to accuse the bad condition
of our senses.  And we returned to the bung - hole. M. de Chagny put his
two hands together underneath it and, with a last effort, I burst the
bung."
175,24,76,"""What's this?"" cried the viscount.  ""This isn't water!"""
175,24,77,"The viscount put his two full hands close to my lantern ...  I stooped
to look ... and at once threw away the lantern with such violence that
it broke and went out, leaving us in utter darkness."
175,24,78,What I had seen in M. de Chagny's hands ... was gun - powder!
175,24,79,"[1] It is very natural that, at the time when the Persian was writing,
he should take so many precautions against any spirit of incredulity on
the part of those who were likely to read his narrative.  Nowadays,
when we have all seen this sort of room, his precautions would be
superfluous."
175,25,1,THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONCLUDED
175,25,2,"The discovery flung us into a state of alarm that made us forget all
our past and present sufferings.  We now knew all that the monster
meant to convey when he said to Christine Daae:"
175,25,3,"""Yes or no!  If your answer is no, everybody will be dead AND BURIED!"""
175,25,4,"Yes, buried under the ruins of the Paris Grand Opera!"
175,25,5,"The monster had given her until eleven o'clock in the evening.  He had
chosen his time well.  There would be many people, many ""members of the
human race,"" up there, in the resplendent theater.  What finer retinue
could be expected for his funeral?  He would go down to the tomb
escorted by the whitest shoulders in the world, decked with the richest
jewels."
175,25,6,Eleven o'clock to - morrow evening!
175,25,7,"We were all to be blown up in the middle of the performance ...  if
Christine Daae said no!"
175,25,8,Eleven o'clock to - morrow evening! ...
175,25,9,"And what else could Christine say but no?  Would she not prefer to
espouse death itself rather than that living corpse?  She did not know
that on her acceptance or refusal depended the awful fate of many
members of the human race!"
175,25,10,Eleven o'clock to - morrow evening!
175,25,11,"And we dragged ourselves through the darkness, feeling our way to the
stone steps, for the light in the trap - door overhead that led to the
room of mirrors was now extinguished; and we repeated to ourselves:"
175,25,12,"""Eleven o'clock to - morrow evening!"""
175,25,13,"At last, I found the staircase.  But, suddenly I drew myself up on the
first step, for a terrible thought had come to my mind:"
175,25,14,"""What is the time?"""
175,25,15,"Ah, what was the time? ... For, after all, eleven o'clock to - morrow
evening might be now, might be this very moment!  Who could tell us the
time?  We seemed to have been imprisoned in that hell for days and days
... for years ... since the beginning of the world.  Perhaps we should
be blown up then and there!  Ah, a sound!  A crack!  ""Did you hear
that? ... There, in the corner ... good heavens! ...  Like a sound of
machinery! ... Again! ... Oh, for a light! ...  Perhaps it's the
machinery that is to blow everything up! ...  I tell you, a cracking
sound:  are you deaf?"""
175,25,16,"M. de Chagny and I began to yell like madmen.  Fear spurred us on.  We
rushed up the treads of the staircase, stumbling as we went, anything
to escape the dark, to return to the mortal light of the room of
mirrors!"
175,25,17,"We found the trap - door still open, but it was now as dark in the room
of mirrors as in the cellar which we had left.  We dragged ourselves
along the floor of the torture - chamber, the floor that separated us
from the powder - magazine. What was the time?  We shouted, we called: M.
de Chagny to Christine, I to Erik.  I reminded him that I had saved his
life.  But no answer, save that of our despair, of our madness: what
was the time?  We argued, we tried to calculate the time which we had
spent there, but we were incapable of reasoning.  If only we could see
the face of a watch! ...  Mine had stopped, but M. de Chagny's was
still going ...  He told me that he had wound it up before dressing for
the Opera ...  We had not a match upon us ...  And yet we must know ...
M. de Chagny broke the glass of his watch and felt the two hands... He
questioned the hands of the watch with his finger - tips, going by the
position of the ring of the watch ...  Judging by the space between the
hands, he thought it might be just eleven o'clock!"
175,25,18,"But perhaps it was not the eleven o'clock of which we stood in dread.
Perhaps we had still twelve hours before us!"
175,25,19,"Suddenly, I exclaimed:  ""Hush!"""
175,25,20,"I seemed to hear footsteps in the next room.  Some one tapped against
the wall.  Christine Daae's voice said:"
175,25,21,"""Raoul!  Raoul!""  We were now all talking at once, on either side of
the wall.  Christine sobbed; she was not sure that she would find M. de
Chagny alive.  The monster had been terrible, it seemed, had done
nothing but rave, waiting for her to give him the ""yes"" which she
refused.  And yet she had promised him that ""yes,"" if he would take her
to the torture - chamber. But he had obstinately declined, and had
uttered hideous threats against all the members of the human race!  At
last, after hours and hours of that hell, he had that moment gone out,
leaving her alone to reflect for the last time."
175,25,22,"""Hours and hours?  What is the time now?  What is the time, Christine?"""
175,25,23,"""It is eleven o'clock! Eleven o'clock, all but five minutes!"""
175,25,24,"""But which eleven o'clock?"""
175,25,25,"""The eleven o'clock that is to decide life or death! ... He told me so
just before he went ...  He is terrible ...  He is quite mad: he tore
off his mask and his yellow eyes shot flames! ... He did nothing but
laugh! ... He said, 'I give you five minutes to spare your blushes!
Here,' he said, taking a key from the little bag of life and death,
'here is the little bronze key that opens the two ebony caskets on the
mantelpiece in the Louis - Philippe room...  In one of the caskets, you
will find a scorpion, in the other, a grasshopper, both very cleverly
imitated in Japanese bronze: they will say yes or no for you.  If you
turn the scorpion round, that will mean to me, when I return, that you
have said yes.  The grasshopper will mean no.'  And he laughed like a
drunken demon.  I did nothing but beg and entreat him to give me the
key of the torture - chamber, promising to be his wife if he granted me
that request ...  But he told me that there was no future need for that
key and that he was going to throw it into the lake! ...  And he again
laughed like a drunken demon and left me.  Oh, his last words were,
'The grasshopper!  Be careful of the grasshopper!  A grasshopper does
not only turn:  it hops!  It hops!  And it hops jolly high!'"""
175,25,26,"The five minutes had nearly elapsed and the scorpion and the
grasshopper were scratching at my brain.  Nevertheless, I had
sufficient lucidity left to understand that, if the grasshopper were
turned, it would hop ... and with it many members of the human race!
There was no doubt but that the grasshopper controlled an electric
current intended to blow up the powder - magazine!"
175,25,27,"M. de Chagny, who seemed to have recovered all his moral force from
hearing Christine's voice, explained to her, in a few hurried words,
the situation in which we and all the Opera were.  He told her to turn
the scorpion at once."
175,25,28,There was a pause.
175,25,29,"""Christine,"" I cried, ""where are you?"""
175,25,30,"""By the scorpion."""
175,25,31,"""Don't touch it!"""
175,25,32,"The idea had come to me -  - for I knew my Erik -  - that the monster had
perhaps deceived the girl once more.  Perhaps it was the scorpion that
would blow everything up.  After all, why wasn't he there?  The five
minutes were long past ... and he was not back...  Perhaps he had taken
shelter and was waiting for the explosion!  ... Why had he not
returned? ... He could not really expect Christine ever to consent to
become his voluntary prey! ... Why had he not returned?"
175,25,33,"""Don't touch the scorpion!""  I said."
175,25,34,"""Here he comes!"" cried Christine.  ""I hear him!  Here he is!"""
175,25,35,"We heard his steps approaching the Louis - Philippe room.  He came up to
Christine, but did not speak.  Then I raised my voice:"
175,25,36,"""Erik!  It is I!  Do you know me?"""
175,25,37,"With extraordinary calmness, he at once replied:"
175,25,38,"""So you are not dead in there?  Well, then, see that you keep quiet."""
175,25,39,"I tried to speak, but he said coldly:"
175,25,40,"""Not a word, daroga, or I shall blow everything up.""  And he added,
""The honor rests with mademoiselle ...  Mademoiselle has not touched
the scorpion"" -  - how deliberately he spoke! -  - ""mademoiselle has not
touched the grasshopper"" -  - with that composure! -  - ""but it is not too late
to do the right thing.  There, I open the caskets without a key, for I
am a trap - door lover and I open and shut what I please and as I please.
I open the little ebony caskets: mademoiselle, look at the little dears
inside.  Aren't they pretty?  If you turn the grasshopper,
mademoiselle, we shall all be blown up.  There is enough gun - powder
under our feet to blow up a whole quarter of Paris.  If you turn the
scorpion, mademoiselle, all that powder will be soaked and drowned.
Mademoiselle, to celebrate our wedding, you shall make a very handsome
present to a few hundred Parisians who are at this moment applauding a
poor masterpiece of Meyerbeer's ... you shall make them a present of
their lives ...  For, with your own fair hands, you shall turn the
scorpion ...  And merrily, merrily, we will be married!"""
175,25,41,A pause; and then:
175,25,42,"""If, in two minutes, mademoiselle, you have not turned the scorpion, I
shall turn the grasshopper ... and the grasshopper, I tell you, HOPS
JOLLY HIGH!"""
175,25,43,"The terrible silence began anew.  The Vicomte de Chagny, realizing that
there was nothing left to do but pray, went down on his knees and
prayed.  As for me, my blood beat so fiercely that I had to take my
heart in both hands, lest it should burst.  At last, we heard Erik's
voice:"
175,25,44,"""The two minutes are past ...  Good - by, mademoiselle...  Hop,
grasshopper!  ""Erik,"" cried Christine, ""do you swear to me, monster, do
you swear to me that the scorpion is the one to turn?"
175,25,45,"""Yes, to hop at our wedding."""
175,25,46,"""Ah, you see!  You said, to hop!"""
175,25,47,"""At our wedding, ingenuous child! ... The scorpion opens the ball...
But that will do! ... You won't have the scorpion?  Then I turn the
grasshopper!"""
175,25,48,"""Erik!"""
175,25,49,"""Enough!"""
175,25,50,"I was crying out in concert with Christine.  M. de Chagny was still on
his knees, praying."
175,25,51,"""Erik!  I have turned the scorpion!"""
175,25,52,"Oh, the second through which we passed!"
175,25,53,"Waiting!  Waiting to find ourselves in fragments, amid the roar and the
ruins!"
175,25,54,"Feeling something crack beneath our feet, hearing an appalling hiss
through the open trap - door, a hiss like the first sound of a rocket!"
175,25,55,"It came softly, at first, then louder, then very loud.  But it was not
the hiss of fire.  It was more like the hiss of water.  And now it
became a gurgling sound:  ""Guggle!  Guggle!"""
175,25,56,"We rushed to the trap - door. All our thirst, which vanished when the
terror came, now returned with the lapping of the water."
175,25,57,"The water rose in the cellar, above the barrels, the
powder - barrels -  - ""Barrels! ...  Barrels!  Any barrels to sell?"" -  - and we
went down to it with parched throats.  It rose to our chins, to our
mouths. And we drank.  We stood on the floor of the cellar and drank.
And we went up the stairs again in the dark, step by step, went up with
the water."
175,25,58,"The water came out of the cellar with us and spread over the floor of
the room.  If, this went on, the whole house on the lake would be
swamped.  The floor of the torture - chamber had itself become a regular
little lake, in which our feet splashed.  Surely there was water enough
now!  Erik must turn off the tap!"
175,25,59,"""Erik!  Erik!  That is water enough for the gunpowder!  Turn off the
tap!  Turn off the scorpion!"""
175,25,60,"But Erik did not reply.  We heard nothing but the water rising: it was
half - way to our waists!"
175,25,61,"""Christine!"" cried M. de Chagny.  ""Christine!  The water is up to our
knees!"""
175,25,62,But Christine did not reply ...  We heard nothing but the water rising.
175,25,63,"No one, no one in the next room, no one to turn the tap, no one to turn
the scorpion!"
175,25,64,"We were all alone, in the dark, with the dark water that seized us and
clasped us and froze us!"
175,25,65,"""Erik!  Erik!"""
175,25,66,"""Christine!  Christine!"""
175,25,67,"By this time, we had lost our foothold and were spinning round in the
water, carried away by an irresistible whirl, for the water turned with
us and dashed us against the dark mirror, which thrust us back again;
and our throats, raised above the whirlpool, roared aloud."
175,25,68,"Were we to die here, drowned in the torture - chamber? I had never seen
that.  Erik, at the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, had never
shown me that, through the little invisible window."
175,25,69,"""Erik!  Erik!""  I cried.  ""I saved your life!  Remember! ... You were
sentenced to death!  But for me, you would be dead now! ...  Erik!"""
175,25,70,"We whirled around in the water like so much wreckage.  But, suddenly,
my straying hands seized the trunk of the iron tree!  I called M. de
Chagny, and we both hung to the branch of the iron tree."
175,25,71,And the water rose still higher.
175,25,72,"""Oh!  Oh!  Can you remember?  How much space is there between the
branch of the tree and the dome - shaped ceiling?  Do try to remember!
...  After all, the water may stop, it must find its level! ... There,
I think it is stopping! ... No, no, oh, horrible! ... Swim!  Swim for
your life!"""
175,25,73,"Our arms became entangled in the effort of swimming; we choked; we
fought in the dark water; already we could hardly breathe the dark air
above the dark water, the air which escaped, which we could hear
escaping through some vent - hole or other."
175,25,74,"""Oh, let us turn and turn and turn until we find the air hole and then
glue our mouths to it!"""
175,25,75,"But I lost my strength; I tried to lay hold of the walls!  Oh, how
those glass walls slipped from under my groping fingers! ... We whirled
round again! ... We began to sink!  ... One last effort! ... A last
cry:  ""Erik! ... Christine! ..."""
175,25,76,"""Guggle, guggle, guggle!"" in our ears.  ""Guggle!  Guggle!""  At the
bottom of the dark water, our ears went, ""Guggle!  Guggle!"""
175,25,77,"And, before losing consciousness entirely, I seemed to hear, between
two guggles:"
175,25,78,"""Barrels!  Barrels!  Any barrels to sell?"""
175,26,1,"The previous chapter marks the conclusion of the written narrative
which the Persian left behind him."
175,26,2,"Notwithstanding the horrors of a situation which seemed definitely to
abandon them to their deaths, M. de Chagny and his companion were saved
by the sublime devotion of Christine Daae.  And I had the rest of the
story from the lips of the daroga himself."
175,26,3,"When I went to see him, he was still living in his little flat in the
Rue de Rivoli, opposite the Tuileries.  He was very ill, and it
required all my ardor as an historian pledged to the truth to persuade
him to live the incredible tragedy over again for my benefit.  His
faithful old servant Darius showed me in to him.  The daroga received
me at a window overlooking the garden of the Tuileries.  He still had
his magnificent eyes, but his poor face looked very worn.  He had
shaved the whole of his head, which was usually covered with an
astrakhan cap; he was dressed in a long, plain coat and amused himself
by unconsciously twisting his thumbs inside the sleeves; but his mind
was quite clear, and he told me his story with perfect lucidity."
175,26,4,"It seems that, when he opened his eyes, the daroga found himself lying
on a bed.  M. de Chagny was on a sofa, beside the wardrobe.  An angel
and a devil were watching over them."
175,26,5,"After the deceptions and illusions of the torture - chamber, the
precision of the details of that quiet little middle - class room seemed
to have been invented for the express purpose of puzzling the mind of
the mortal rash enough to stray into that abode of living nightmare.
The wooden bedstead, the waxed mahogany chairs, the chest of drawers,
those brasses, the little square antimacassars carefully placed on the
backs of the chairs, the clock on the mantelpiece and the
harmless - looking ebony caskets at either end, lastly, the whatnot
filled with shells, with red pin - cushions, with mother - of - pearl boats
and an enormous ostrich - egg, the whole discreetly lighted by a shaded
lamp standing on a small round table:  this collection of ugly,
peaceable, reasonable furniture, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OPERA CELLARS,
bewildered the imagination more than all the late fantastic happenings."
175,26,6,"And the figure of the masked man seemed all the more formidable in this
old - fashioned, neat and trim little frame.  It bent down over the
Persian and said, in his ear:"
175,26,7,"""Are you better, daroga? ... You are looking at my furniture? ...  It
is all that I have left of my poor unhappy mother."""
175,26,8,"Christine Daae did not say a word:  she moved about noiselessly, like a
sister of charity, who had taken a vow of silence.  She brought a cup
of cordial, or of hot tea, he did not remember which.  The man in the
mask took it from her hands and gave it to the Persian.  M. de Chagny
was still sleeping."
175,26,9,"Erik poured a drop of rum into the daroga's cup and, pointing to the
viscount, said:"
175,26,10,"""He came to himself long before we knew if you were still alive,
daroga.  He is quite well.  He is asleep.  We must not wake him."""
175,26,11,"Erik left the room for a moment, and the Persian raised himself on his
elbow, looked around him and saw Christine Daae sitting by the
fireside.  He spoke to her, called her, but he was still very weak and
fell back on his pillow.  Christine came to him, laid her hand on his
forehead and went away again.  And the Persian remembered that, as she
went, she did not give a glance at M. de Chagny, who, it is true, was
sleeping peacefully; and she sat down again in her chair by the
chimney - corner, silent as a sister of charity who had taken a vow of
silence."
175,26,12,"Erik returned with some little bottles which he placed on the
mantelpiece.  And, again in a whisper, so as not to wake M. de Chagny,
he said to the Persian, after sitting down and feeling his pulse:"
175,26,13,"""You are now saved, both of you.  And soon I shall take you up to the
surface of the earth, TO PLEASE MY WIFE."""
175,26,14,"Thereupon he rose, without any further explanation, and disappeared
once more."
175,26,15,"The Persian now looked at Christine's quiet profile under the lamp.
She was reading a tiny book, with gilt edges, like a religious book.
There are editions of THE IMITATION that look like that.  The Persian
still had in his ears the natural tone in which the other had said, ""to
please my wife.""  Very gently, he called her again; but Christine was
wrapped up in her book and did not hear him."
175,26,16,"Erik returned, mixed the daroga a draft and advised him not to speak to
""his wife"" again nor to any one, BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE VERY DANGEROUS TO
EVERYBODY'S HEALTH."
175,26,17,"Eventually, the Persian fell asleep, like M. de Chagny, and did not
wake until he was in his own room, nursed by his faithful Darius, who
told him that, on the night before, he was found propped against the
door of his flat, where he had been brought by a stranger, who rang the
bell before going away."
175,26,18,"As soon as the daroga recovered his strength and his wits, he sent to
Count Philippe's house to inquire after the viscount's health.  The
answer was that the young man had not been seen and that Count Philippe
was dead.  His body was found on the bank of the Opera lake, on the
Rue - Scribe side.  The Persian remembered the requiem mass which he had
heard from behind the wall of the torture - chamber, and had no doubt
concerning the crime and the criminal.  Knowing Erik as he did, he
easily reconstructed the tragedy.  Thinking that his brother had run
away with Christine Daae, Philippe had dashed in pursuit of him along
the Brussels Road, where he knew that everything was prepared for the
elopement.  Failing to find the pair, he hurried back to the Opera,
remembered Raoul's strange confidence about his fantastic rival and
learned that the viscount had made every effort to enter the cellars of
the theater and that he had disappeared, leaving his hat in the prima
donna's dressing - room beside an empty pistol - case. And the count, who
no longer entertained any doubt of his brother's madness, in his turn
darted into that infernal underground maze.  This was enough, in the
Persian's eyes, to explain the discovery of the Comte de Chagny's
corpse on the shore of the lake, where the siren, Erik's siren, kept
watch."
175,26,19,"The Persian did not hesitate.  He determined to inform the police.  Now
the case was in the hands of an examining - magistrate called Faure, an
incredulous, commonplace, superficial sort of person, (I write as I
think), with a mind utterly unprepared to receive a confidence of this
kind.  M. Faure took down the daroga's depositions and proceeded to
treat him as a madman."
175,26,20,"Despairing of ever obtaining a hearing, the Persian sat down to write.
As the police did not want his evidence, perhaps the press would be
glad of it; and he had just written the last line of the narrative I
have quoted in the preceding chapters, when Darius announced the visit
of a stranger who refused his name, who would not show his face and
declared simply that he did not intend to leave the place until he had
spoken to the daroga."
175,26,21,"The Persian at once felt who his singular visitor was and ordered him
to be shown in.  The daroga was right.  It was the ghost, it was Erik!"
175,26,22,"He looked extremely weak and leaned against the wall, as though he were
afraid of falling.  Taking off his hat, he revealed a forehead white as
wax.  The rest of the horrible face was hidden by the mask."
175,26,23,The Persian rose to his feet as Erik entered.
175,26,24,"""Murderer of Count Philippe, what have you done with his brother and
Christine Daae?"""
175,26,25,"Erik staggered under this direct attack, kept silent for a moment,
dragged himself to a chair and heaved a deep sigh.  Then, speaking in
short phrases and gasping for breath between the words:"
175,26,26,"""Daroga, don't talk to me ... about Count Philippe ...  He was dead ...
by the time ... I left my house ... he was dead ... when ...  the siren
sang ...  It was an ... accident ... a sad ... a very sad ... accident.
He fell very awkwardly ... but simply and naturally ...  into the lake!
..."""
175,26,27,"""You lie!"" shouted the Persian."
175,26,28,Erik bowed his head and said:
175,26,29,"""I have not come here ... to talk about Count Philippe ...  but to tell
you that ... I am going ... to die..."""
175,26,30,"""Where are Raoul de Chagny and Christine Daae?"""
175,26,31,"""I am going to die."""
175,26,32,"""Raoul de Chagny and Christine Daae?"""
175,26,33,"""Of love ... daroga ... I am dying ... of love ... That is how it is
... loved her so! ... And I love her still ... daroga ... and I am
dying of love for her, I ... I tell you! ... If you knew how beautiful
she was ...  when she let me kiss her ... alive ... It was the first
... time, daroga, the first ... time I ever kissed a woman ...  Yes,
alive ...  I kissed her alive ... and she looked as beautiful as if she
had been dead!"""
175,26,34,The Persian shook Erik by the arm:
175,26,35,"""Will you tell me if she is alive or dead."""
175,26,36,"""Why do you shake me like that?"" asked Erik, making an effort to speak
more connectedly.  ""I tell you that I am going to die...  Yes, I kissed
her alive ..."""
175,26,37,"""And now she is dead?"""
175,26,38,"""I tell you I kissed her just like that, on her forehead ...  and she
did not draw back her forehead from my lips! ... Oh, she is a good
girl! ... As to her being dead, I don't think so; but it has nothing to
do with me ...  No, no, she is not dead!  And no one shall touch a hair
of her head!  She is a good, honest girl, and she saved your life,
daroga, at a moment when I would not have given twopence for your
Persian skin.  As a matter of fact, nobody bothered about you.  Why
were you there with that little chap?  You would have died as well as
he!  My word, how she entreated me for her little chap!  But I told her
that, as she had turned the scorpion, she had, through that very fact,
and of her own free will, become engaged to me and that she did not
need to have two men engaged to her, which was true enough."
175,26,39,"""As for you, you did not exist, you had ceased to exist, I tell you,
and you were going to die with the other! ... Only, mark me, daroga,
when you were yelling like the devil, because of the water, Christine
came to me with her beautiful blue eyes wide open, and swore to me, as
she hoped to be saved, that she consented to be MY LIVING WIFE! ...
Until then, in the depths of her eyes, daroga, I had always seen my
dead wife; it was the first time I saw MY LIVING WIFE there.  She was
sincere, as she hoped to be saved.  She would not kill herself.  It was
a bargain ...  Half a minute later, all the water was back in the lake;
and I had a hard job with you, daroga, for, upon my honor, I thought
you were done for! ...  However! ... There you were! ... It was
understood that I was to take you both up to the surface of the earth.
When, at last, I cleared the Louis - Philippe room of you, I came back
alone ..."""
175,26,40,"""What have you done with the Vicomte de Chagny?"" asked the Persian,
interrupting him."
175,26,41,"""Ah, you see, daroga, I couldn't carry HIM up like that, at once.  ...
He was a hostage ...  But I could not keep him in the house on the
lake, either, because of Christine; so I locked him up comfortably, I
chained him up nicely -  - a whiff of the Mazenderan scent had left him as
limp as a rag -  - in the Communists' dungeon, which is in the most
deserted and remote part of the Opera, below the fifth cellar, where no
one ever comes, and where no one ever hears you.  Then I came back to
Christine, she was waiting for me."""
175,26,42,"Erik here rose solemnly.  Then he continued, but, as he spoke, he was
overcome by all his former emotion and began to tremble like a leaf:"
175,26,43,"""Yes, she was waiting for me ... waiting for me erect and alive, a
real, living bride ... as she hoped to be saved ...  And, when I ...
came forward, more timid than ... a little child, she did not run away
... no, no ... she stayed ... she waited for me ...  I even believe ...
daroga ... that she put out her forehead ... a little ... oh, not much
... just a little ...  like a living bride ...  And ... and ... I ...
kissed her! ...  I! ... I! ... I! ... And she did not die! ... Oh, how
good it is, daroga, to kiss somebody on the forehead! ... You can't
tell! ...  But I!  I! ... My mother, daroga, my poor, unhappy mother
would never ... let me kiss her ...  She used to run away ... and throw
me my mask!  ... Nor any other woman ... ever, ever! ... Ah, you can
understand, my happiness was so great, I cried.  And I fell at her
feet, crying ... and I kissed her feet ... her little feet ... crying.
You're crying, too, daroga ... and she cried also ... the angel cried!
..."" Erik sobbed aloud and the Persian himself could not retain his
tears in the presence of that masked man, who, with his shoulders
shaking and his hands clutched at his chest, was moaning with pain and
love by turns."
175,26,44,"""Yes, daroga ... I felt her tears flow on my forehead ... on mine,
mine! ... They were soft ... they were sweet! ... They trickled under
my mask ... they mingled with my tears in my eyes ... yes ... they
flowed between my lips ...  Listen, daroga, listen to what I did ...  I
tore off my mask so as not to lose one of her tears ... and she did not
run away! ... And she did not die! ...  She remained alive, weeping
over me, with me.  We cried together!  I have tasted all the happiness
the world can offer!"""
175,26,45,"And Erik fell into a chair, choking for breath:"
175,26,46,"""Ah, I am not going to die yet ... presently I shall ... but let me
cry! ... Listen, daroga ... listen to this ...  While I was at her feet
... I heard her say, 'Poor, unhappy Erik!' ...  AND SHE TOOK MY HAND!
... I had become no more, you know, than a poor dog ready to die for
her ...  I mean it, daroga! ...  I held in my hand a ring, a plain gold
ring which I had given her ... which she had lost ... and which I had
found again ...  a wedding - ring, you know ...  I slipped it into her
little hand and said, 'There! ... Take it! ... Take it for you ... and
him!  ... It shall be my wedding - present a present from your poor,
unhappy Erik ...  I know you love the boy ... don't cry any more!  ...
She asked me, in a very soft voice, what I meant ...  Then I made her
understand that, where she was concerned, I was only a poor dog, ready
to die for her ... but that she could marry the young man when she
pleased, because she had cried with me and mingled her tears with mine!
..."""
175,26,47,"Erik's emotion was so great that he had to tell the Persian not to look
at him, for he was choking and must take off his mask.  The daroga went
to the window and opened it.  His heart was full of pity, but he took
care to keep his eyes fixed on the trees in the Tuileries gardens, lest
he should see the monster's face."
175,26,48,"""I went and released the young man,"" Erik continued, ""and told him to
come with me to Christine ...  They kissed before me in the
Louis - Philippe room ...  Christine had my ring ...  I made Christine
swear to come back, one night, when I was dead, crossing the lake from
the Rue - Scribe side, and bury me in the greatest secrecy with the gold
ring, which she was to wear until that moment.  ... I told her where
she would find my body and what to do with it...  Then Christine kissed
me, for the first time, herself, here, on the forehead -  - don't look,
daroga! -  - here, on the forehead ... on my forehead, mine -  - don't look,
daroga! -  - and they went off together...  Christine had stopped crying
...  I alone cried ...  Daroga, daroga, if Christine keeps her promise,
she will come back soon! ..."""
175,26,49,"The Persian asked him no questions.  He was quite reassured as to the
fate of Raoul Chagny and Christine Daae; no one could have doubted the
word of the weeping Erik that night."
175,26,50,"The monster resumed his mask and collected his strength to leave the
daroga.  He told him that, when he felt his end to be very near at
hand, he would send him, in gratitude for the kindness which the
Persian had once shown him, that which he held dearest in the world:
all Christine Daae's papers, which she had written for Raoul's benefit
and left with Erik, together with a few objects belonging to her, such
as a pair of gloves, a shoe - buckle and two pocket - handkerchiefs. In
reply to the Persian's questions, Erik told him that the two young
people, at soon as they found themselves free, had resolved to go and
look for a priest in some lonely spot where they could hide their
happiness and that, with this object in view, they had started from
""the northern railway station of the world.""  Lastly, Erik relied on
the Persian, as soon as he received the promised relics and papers, to
inform the young couple of his death and to advertise it in the EPOQUE."
175,26,51,"That was all.  The Persian saw Erik to the door of his flat, and Darius
helped him down to the street.  A cab was waiting for him.  Erik
stepped in; and the Persian, who had gone back to the window, heard him
say to the driver:"
175,26,52,"""Go to the Opera."""
175,26,53,And the cab drove off into the night.
175,26,54,"The Persian had seen the poor, unfortunate Erik for the last time.
Three weeks later, the Epoque published this advertisement:"
175,26,55,"""Erik is dead."""
175,26,56,Epilogue.
175,26,57,"I have now told the singular, but veracious story of the Opera ghost.
As I declared on the first page of this work, it is no longer possible
to deny that Erik really lived.  There are to - day so many proofs of his
existence within the reach of everybody that we can follow Erik's
actions logically through the whole tragedy of the Chagnys."
175,26,58,"There is no need to repeat here how greatly the case excited the
capital.  The kidnapping of the artist, the death of the Comte de
Chagny under such exceptional conditions, the disappearance of his
brother, the drugging of the gas - man at the Opera and of his two
assistants: what tragedies, what passions, what crimes had surrounded
the idyll of Raoul and the sweet and charming Christine! ... What had
become of that wonderful, mysterious artist of whom the world was
never, never to hear again? ... She was represented as the victim of a
rivalry between the two brothers; and nobody suspected what had really
happened, nobody understood that, as Raoul and Christine had both
disappeared, both had withdrawn far from the world to enjoy a happiness
which they would not have cared to make public after the inexplicable
death of Count Philippe ...  They took the train one day from ""the
northern railway station of the world."" ... Possibly, I too shall take
the train at that station, one day, and go and seek around thy lakes, O
Norway, O silent Scandinavia, for the perhaps still living traces of
Raoul and Christine and also of Mamma Valerius, who disappeared at the
same time! ... Possibly, some day, I shall hear the lonely echoes of
the North repeat the singing of her who knew the Angel of Music! ..."
175,26,59,"Long after the case was pigeonholed by the unintelligent care of M. le
Juge d'Instruction Faure, the newspapers made efforts, at intervals, to
fathom the mystery.  One evening paper alone, which knew all the gossip
of the theaters, said:"
175,26,60,"""We recognize the touch of the Opera ghost."""
175,26,61,And even that was written by way of irony.
175,26,62,"The Persian alone knew the whole truth and held the main proofs, which
came to him with the pious relics promised by the ghost.  It fell to my
lot to complete those proofs with the aid of the daroga himself.  Day
by day, I kept him informed of the progress of my inquiries; and he
directed them.  He had not been to the Opera for years and years, but
he had preserved the most accurate recollection of the building, and
there was no better guide than he possible to help me discover its most
secret recesses.  He also told me where to gather further information,
whom to ask; and he sent me to call on M. Poligny, at a moment when the
poor man was nearly drawing his last breath.  I had no idea that he was
so very ill, and I shall never forget the effect which my questions
about the ghost produced upon him.  He looked at me as if I were the
devil and answered only in a few incoherent sentences, which showed,
however -  - and that was the main thing -  - the extent of the perturbation
which O. G., in his time, had brought into that already very restless
life (for M. Poligny was what people call a man of pleasure)."
175,26,63,"When I came and told the Persian of the poor result of my visit to M.
Poligny, the daroga gave a faint smile and said:"
175,26,64,"""Poligny never knew how far that extraordinary blackguard of an Erik
humbugged him."" -  - The Persian, by the way, spoke of Erik sometimes as a
demigod and sometimes as the lowest of the low -  - ""Poligny was
superstitious and Erik knew it.  Erik knew most things about the public
and private affairs of the Opera.  When M. Poligny heard a mysterious
voice tell him, in Box Five, of the manner in which he used to spend
his time and abuse his partner's confidence, he did not wait to hear
any more.  Thinking at first that it was a voice from Heaven, he
believed himself damned; and then, when the voice began to ask for
money, he saw that he was being victimized by a shrewd blackmailer to
whom Debienne himself had fallen a prey.  Both of them, already tired
of management for various reasons, went away without trying to
investigate further into the personality of that curious O. G., who had
forced such a singular memorandum - book upon them.  They bequeathed the
whole mystery to their successors and heaved a sigh of relief when they
were rid of a business that had puzzled them without amusing them in
the least."""
175,26,65,"I then spoke of the two successors and expressed my surprise that, in
his Memoirs of a Manager, M. Moncharmin should describe the Opera
ghost's behavior at such length in the first part of the book and
hardly mention it at all in the second.  In reply to this, the Persian,
who knew the MEMOIRS as thoroughly as if he had written them himself,
observed that I should find the explanation of the whole business if I
would just recollect the few lines which Moncharmin devotes to the
ghost in the second part aforesaid.  I quote these lines, which are
particularly interesting because they describe the very simple manner
in which the famous incident of the twenty - thousand francs was closed:"
175,26,66,"""As for O. G., some of whose curious tricks I have related in the first
part of my Memoirs, I will only say that he redeemed by one spontaneous
fine action all the worry which he had caused my dear friend and
partner and, I am bound to say, myself.  He felt, no doubt, that there
are limits to a joke, especially when it is so expensive and when the
commissary of police has been informed, for, at the moment when we had
made an appointment in our office with M. Mifroid to tell him the whole
story, a few days after the disappearance of Christine Daae, we found,
on Richard's table, a large envelope, inscribed, in red ink, ""WITH O.
G.'S COMPLIMENTS.""  It contained the large sum of money which he had
succeeded in playfully extracting, for the time being, from the
treasury.  Richard was at once of the opinion that we must be content
with that and drop the business.  I agreed with Richard.  All's well
that ends well.  What do you say, O. G.?"""
175,26,67,"Of course, Moncharmin, especially after the money had been restored,
continued to believe that he had, for a short while, been the butt of
Richard's sense of humor, whereas Richard, on his side, was convinced
that Moncharmin had amused himself by inventing the whole of the affair
of the Opera ghost, in order to revenge himself for a few jokes."
175,26,68,"I asked the Persian to tell me by what trick the ghost had taken
twenty - thousand francs from Richard's pocket in spite of the
safety - pin. He replied that he had not gone into this little detail,
but that, if I myself cared to make an investigation on the spot, I
should certainly find the solution to the riddle in the managers'
office by remembering that Erik had not been nicknamed the trap - door
lover for nothing.  I promised the Persian to do so as soon as I had
time, and I may as well tell the reader at once that the results of my
investigation were perfectly satisfactory; and I hardly believed that I
should ever discover so many undeniable proofs of the authenticity of
the feats ascribed to the ghost."
175,26,69,"The Persian's manuscript, Christine Daae's papers, the statements made
to me by the people who used to work under MM. Richard and Moncharmin,
by little Meg herself (the worthy Madame Giry, I am sorry to say, is no
more) and by Sorelli, who is now living in retirement at Louveciennes:
all the documents relating to the existence of the ghost, which I
propose to deposit in the archives of the Opera, have been checked and
confirmed by a number of important discoveries of which I am justly
proud.  I have not been able to find the house on the lake, Erik having
blocked up all the secret entrances.[1]  On the other hand, I have
discovered the secret passage of the Communists, the planking of which
is falling to pieces in parts, and also the trap - door through which
Raoul and the Persian penetrated into the cellars of the opera - house.
In the Communists' dungeon, I noticed numbers of initials traced on the
walls by the unfortunate people confined in it; and among these were an
""R"" and a ""C."" R. C.: Raoul de Chagny.  The letters are there to this
day."
175,26,70,"If the reader will visit the Opera one morning and ask leave to stroll
where he pleases, without being accompanied by a stupid guide, let him
go to Box Five and knock with his fist or stick on the enormous column
that separates this from the stage - box. He will find that the column
sounds hollow.  After that, do not be astonished by the suggestion that
it was occupied by the voice of the ghost:  there is room inside the
column for two men.  If you are surprised that, when the various
incidents occurred, no one turned round to look at the column, you must
remember that it presented the appearance of solid marble, and that the
voice contained in it seemed rather to come from the opposite side,
for, as we have seen, the ghost was an expert ventriloquist."
175,26,71,"The column was elaborately carved and decorated with the sculptor's
chisel; and I do not despair of one day discovering the ornament that
could be raised or lowered at will, so as to admit of the ghost's
mysterious correspondence with Mme. Giry and of his generosity."
175,26,72,"However, all these discoveries are nothing, to my mind, compared with
that which I was able to make, in the presence of the acting - manager,
in the managers' office, within a couple of inches from the desk - chair,
and which consisted of a trap - door, the width of a board in the
flooring and the length of a man's fore - arm and no longer; a trap - door
that falls back like the lid of a box; a trap - door through which I can
see a hand come and dexterously fumble at the pocket of a swallow - tail
coat."
175,26,73,"That is the way the forty - thousand francs went! ...  And that also is
the way by which, through some trick or other, they were returned."
175,26,74,"Speaking about this to the Persian, I said:"
175,26,75,"""So we may take it, as the forty - thousand francs were returned, that
Erik was simply amusing himself with that memorandum - book of his?"""
175,26,76,"""Don't you believe it!"" he replied.  ""Erik wanted money.  Thinking
himself without the pale of humanity, he was restrained by no scruples
and he employed his extraordinary gifts of dexterity and imagination,
which he had received by way of compensation for his extraordinary
uglinesss, to prey upon his fellow - men. His reason for restoring the
forty - thousand francs, of his own accord, was that he no longer wanted
it.  He had relinquished his marriage with Christine Daae.  He had
relinquished everything above the surface of the earth."""
175,26,77,"According to the Persian's account, Erik was born in a small town not
far from Rouen.  He was the son of a master - mason. He ran away at an
early age from his father's house, where his ugliness was a subject of
horror and terror to his parents.  For a time, he frequented the fairs,
where a showman exhibited him as the ""living corpse."" He seems to have
crossed the whole of Europe, from fair to fair, and to have completed
his strange education as an artist and magician at the very
fountain - head of art and magic, among the Gipsies.  A period of Erik's
life remained quite obscure.  He was seen at the fair of
Nijni - Novgorod, where he displayed himself in all his hideous glory.
He already sang as nobody on this earth had ever sung before; he
practised ventriloquism and gave displays of legerdemain so
extraordinary that the caravans returning to Asia talked about it
during the whole length of their journey.  In this way, his reputation
penetrated the walls of the palace at Mazenderan, where the little
sultana, the favorite of the Shah - in - Shah, was boring herself to death.
A dealer in furs, returning to Samarkand from Nijni - Novgorod, told of
the marvels which he had seen performed in Erik's tent.  The trader was
summoned to the palace and the daroga of Mazenderan was told to
question him.  Next the daroga was instructed to go and find Erik.  He
brought him to Persia, where for some months Erik's will was law.  He
was guilty of not a few horrors, for he seemed not to know the
difference between good and evil.  He took part calmly in a number of
political assassinations; and he turned his diabolical inventive powers
against the Emir of Afghanistan, who was at war with the Persian
empire.  The Shah took a liking to him."
175,26,78,"This was the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, of which the
daroga's narrative has given us a glimpse.  Erik had very original
ideas on the subject of architecture and thought out a palace much as a
conjuror contrives a trick - casket. The Shah ordered him to construct an
edifice of this kind.  Erik did so; and the building appears to have
been so ingenious that His Majesty was able to move about in it unseen
and to disappear without a possibility of the trick's being discovered.
When the Shah - in - Shah found himself the possessor of this gem, he
ordered Erik's yellow eyes to be put out.  But he reflected that, even
when blind, Erik would still be able to build so remarkable a house for
another sovereign; and also that, as long as Erik was alive, some one
would know the secret of the wonderful palace.  Erik's death was
decided upon, together with that of all the laborers who had worked
under his orders.  The execution of this abominable decree devolved
upon the daroga of Mazenderan.  Erik had shown him some slight services
and procured him many a hearty laugh.  He saved Erik by providing him
with the means of escape, but nearly paid with his head for his
generous indulgence."
175,26,79,"Fortunately for the daroga, a corpse, half - eaten by the birds of prey,
was found on the shore of the Caspian Sea, and was taken for Erik's
body, because the daroga's friends had dressed the remains in clothing
that belonged to Erik.  The daroga was let off with the loss of the
imperial favor, the confiscation of his property and an order of
perpetual banishment.  As a member of the Royal House, however, he
continued to receive a monthly pension of a few hundred francs from the
Persian treasury; and on this he came to live in Paris."
175,26,80,"As for Erik, he went to Asia Minor and thence to Constantinople, where
he entered the Sultan's employment.  In explanation of the services
which he was able to render a monarch haunted by perpetual terrors, I
need only say that it was Erik who constructed all the famous
trap - doors and secret chambers and mysterious strong - boxes which were
found at Yildiz - Kiosk after the last Turkish revolution.  He also
invented those automata, dressed like the Sultan and resembling the
Sultan in all respects,[2] which made people believe that the
Commander of the Faithful was awake at one place, when, in reality, he
was asleep elsewhere."
175,26,81,"Of course, he had to leave the Sultan's service for the same reasons
that made him fly from Persia:  he knew too much.  Then, tired of his
adventurous, formidable and monstrous life, he longed to be some one
""like everybody else.""  And he became a contractor, like any ordinary
contractor, building ordinary houses with ordinary bricks.  He tendered
for part of the foundations in the Opera.  His estimate was accepted.
When he found himself in the cellars of the enormous playhouse, his
artistic, fantastic, wizard nature resumed the upper hand.  Besides,
was he not as ugly as ever?  He dreamed of creating for his own use a
dwelling unknown to the rest of the earth, where he could hide from
men's eyes for all time."
175,26,82,"The reader knows and guesses the rest.  It is all in keeping with this
incredible and yet veracious story.  Poor, unhappy Erik!  Shall we pity
him?  Shall we curse him?  He asked only to be ""some one,"" like
everybody else.  But he was too ugly!  And he had to hide his genius OR
USE IT TO PLAY TRICKS WITH, when, with an ordinary face, he would have
been one of the most distinguished of mankind!  He had a heart that
could have held the empire of the world; and, in the end, he had to
content himself with a cellar.  Ah, yes, we must needs pity the Opera
ghost."
175,26,83,"I have prayed over his mortal remains, that God might show him mercy
notwithstanding his crimes.  Yes, I am sure, quite sure that I prayed
beside his body, the other day, when they took it from the spot where
they were burying the phonographic records.  It was his skeleton.  I
did not recognize it by the ugliness of the head, for all men are ugly
when they have been dead as long as that, but by the plain gold ring
which he wore and which Christine Daae had certainly slipped on his
finger, when she came to bury him in accordance with her promise."
175,26,84,"The skeleton was lying near the little well, in the place where the
Angel of Music first held Christine Daae fainting in his trembling
arms, on the night when he carried her down to the cellars of the
opera - house."
175,26,85,"And, now, what do they mean to do with that skeleton?  Surely they will
not bury it in the common grave! ... I say that the place of the
skeleton of the Opera ghost is in the archives of the National Academy
of Music.  It is no ordinary skeleton."
175,26,86,"[1] Even so, I am convinced that it would be easy to reach it by
draining the lake, as I have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Fine
Arts to do.  I was speaking about it to M. Dujardin - Beaumetz, the
under - secretary for fine arts, only forty - eight hours before the
publication of this book.  Who knows but that the score of DON JUAN
TRIUMPHANT might yet be discovered in the house on the lake?"
175,26,87,"[2] See the interview of the special correspondent of the MATIN, with
Mohammed - Ali Bey, on the day after the entry of the Salonika troops
into Constantinople."
175,26,88,THE END
175,26,89,The Paris Opera House
175,26,90,"THE SCENE OF GASTON LEROUX'S NOVEL, ""THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA"""
175,26,91,"That Mr. Leroux has used, for the scene of his story, the Paris Opera
House as it really is and has not created a building out of his
imagination, is shown by this interesting description of it taken from
an article which appeared in Scribner's Magazine in 1879, a short time
after the building was completed:"
175,26,92,"""The new Opera House, commenced under the Empire and finished under the
Republic, is the most complete building of the kind in the world and in
many respects the most beautiful.  No European capital possesses an
opera house so comprehensive in plan and execution, and none can boast
an edifice equally vast and splendid."
175,26,93,"""The site of the Opera House was chosen in 1861.  It was determined to
lay the foundation exceptionally deep and strong.  It was well known
that water would be met with, but it was impossible to foresee at what
depth or in what quantity it would be found.  Exceptional depth also
was necessary, as the stage arrangements were to be such as to admit a
scene fifty feet high to be lowered on its frame.  It was therefore
necessary to lay a foundation in a soil soaked with water which should
be sufficiently solid to sustain a weight of 22,000,000 pounds, and at
the same time to be perfectly dry, as the cellars were intended for the
storage of scenery and properties.  While the work was in progress, the
excavation was kept free from water by means of eight pumps, worked by
steam power, and in operation, without interruption, day and night,
from March second to October thirteenth.  The floor of the cellar was
covered with a layer of concrete, then with two coats of cement,
another layer of concrete and a coat of bitumen.  The wall includes an
outer wall built as a coffer - dam, a brick wall, a coat of cement, and a
wall proper, a little over a yard thick.  After all this was done the
whole was filled with water, in order that the fluid, by penetrating
into the most minute interstices, might deposit a sediment which would
close them more surely and perfectly than it would be possible to do by
hand.  Twelve years elapsed before the completion of the building, and
during that time it was demonstrated that the precautions taken secured
absolute impermeability and solidity."
175,26,94,"""The events of 1870 interrupted work just as it was about to be
prosecuted most vigorously, and the new Opera House was put to new and
unexpected uses.  During the siege, it was converted into a vast
military storehouse and filled with a heterogeneous mass of goods.
After the siege the building fell into the hands of the Commune and the
roof was turned into a balloon station.  The damage done, however, was
slight."
175,26,95,"""The fine stone employed in the construction was brought from quarries
in Sweden, Scotland, Italy, Algeria, Finland, Spain, Belgium and
France.  While work on the exterior was in progress, the building was
covered in by a wooden shell, rendered transparent by thousands of
small panes of glass.  In 1867 a swarm of men, supplied with hammers
and axes, stripped the house of its habit, and showed in all its
splendor the great structure.  No picture can do justice to the rich
colors of the edifice or to the harmonious tone resulting from the
skilful use of many diverse materials.  The effect of the frontage is
completed by the cupola of the auditorium, topped with a cap of bronze
sparingly adorned with gilding.  Farther on, on a level with the towers
of Notre - Dame, is the gable end of the roof of the stage, a 'Pegasus',
by M. Lequesne, rising at either end of the roof, and a bronze group by
M. Millet, representing 'Apollo lifting his golden lyre', commanding
the apex.  Apollo, it may here be mentioned, is useful as well as
ornamental, for his lyre is tipped with a metal point which does duty
as a lightning - rod, and conducts the fluid to the body and down the
nether limbs of the god."
175,26,96,"""The spectator, having climbed ten steps and left behind him a gateway,
reaches a vestibule in which are statues of Lully, Rameau, Gluck, and
Handel.  Ten steps of green Swedish marble lead to a second vestibule
for ticket - sellers. Visitors who enter by the pavilion reserved for
carriages pass through a hallway where ticket offices are situated.
The larger number of the audience, before entering the auditorium,
traverse a large circular vestibule located exactly beneath it.  The
ceiling of this portion of the building is upheld by sixteen fluted
columns of Jura stone, with white marble capitals, forming a portico.
Here servants are to await their masters, and spectators may remain
until their carriages are summoned.  The third entrance, which is quite
distinct from the others, is reserved for the Executive.  The section
of the building set aside for the use of the Emperor Napoleon was to
have included an antechamber for the bodyguards; a salon for the
aides - de - camp; a large salon and a smaller one for the Empress; hat and
cloak rooms, etc.  Moreover, there were to be in close proximity to the
entrance, stables for three coaches, for the outriders' horses, and for
the twenty - one horsemen acting as an escort; a station for a squad of
infantry of thirty - one men and ten cent - gardes, and a stable for the
horses of the latter; and, besides, a salon for fifteen or twenty
domestics.  Thus arrangements had to be made to accommodate in this
part of the building about one hundred persons, fifty horses, and
half - a - dozen carriages.  The fall of the Empire suggested some changes,
but ample provision still exists for emergencies."
175,26,97,"""Its novel conception, perfect fitness, and rare splendor of material,
make the grand stairway unquestionably one of the most remarkable
features of the building.  It presents to the spectator, who has just
passed through the subscribers' pavilion, a gorgeous picture.  From
this point he beholds the ceiling formed by the central landing; this
and the columns sustaining it, built of Echaillon stone, are
honeycombed with arabesques and heavy with ornaments; the steps are of
white marble, and antique red marble balusters rest on green marble
sockets and support a balustrade of onyx.  To the right and to the left
of this landing are stairways to the floor, on a plane with the first
row of boxes.  On this floor stand thirty monolith columns of
Sarrancolin marble, with white marble bases and capitals.  Pilasters of
peach - blossom and violet stone are against the corresponding walls.
More than fifty blocks had to be extracted from the quarry to find
thirty perfect monoliths."
175,26,98,"""The foyer de la danse has particular interest for the habitues of the
Opera.  It is a place of reunion to which subscribers to three
performances a week are admitted between the acts in accordance with a
usage established in 1870.  Three immense looking - glasses cover the
back wall of the FOYER, and a chandelier with one hundred and seven
burners supplies it with light.  The paintings include twenty oval
medallions, in which are portrayed the twenty danseuses of most
celebrity since the opera has existed in France, and four panels by M.
Boulanger, typifying 'The War Dance', 'The Rustic Dance', 'The Dance of
Love' and 'The Bacchic Dance.' While the ladies of the ballet receive
their admirers in this foyer, they can practise their steps.
Velvet - cushioned bars have to this end been secured at convenient
points, and the floor has been given the same slope as that of the
stage, so that the labor expended may be thoroughly profitable to the
performance. The singers' foyer, on the same floor, is a much less
lively resort than the foyer de la danse, as vocalists rarely leave
their dressing - rooms before they are summoned to the stage.  Thirty
panels with portraits of the artists of repute in the annals of the
Opera adorn this foyer."
175,26,99,"""Some estimate ... may be arrived at by sitting before the concierge an
hour or so before the representation commences.  First appear the stage
carpenters, who are always seventy, and sometimes, when L'Africaine,
for example, with its ship scene, is the opera, one hundred and ten
strong.  Then come stage upholsterers, whose sole duty is to lay
carpets, hang curtains, etc.; gas - men, and a squad of firemen.
Claqueurs, call - boys, property - men, dressers, coiffeurs,
supernumeraries, and artists, follow.  The supernumeraries number about
one hundred; some are hired by the year, but the 'masses' are generally
recruited at the last minute and are generally working - men who seek to
add to their meagre earnings.  There are about a hundred choristers,
and about eighty musicians."
175,26,100,"""Next we behold equeries, whose horses are hoisted on the stage by
means of an elevator; electricians who manage the light - producing
batteries; hydrauliciens to take charge of the water - works in ballets
like La Source; artificers who prepare the conflagration in Le Profeta;
florists who make ready Margarita's garden, and a host of minor
employees.  This personnel is provided for as follows:  Eighty
dressing - rooms are reserved for the artists, each including a small
antechamber, the dressing - room proper, and a little closet.  Besides
these apartments, the Opera has a dressing - room for sixty male, and
another for fifty female choristers; a third for thirty - four male
dancers; four dressing - rooms for twenty female dancers of different
grades; a dressing - room for one hundred and ninety supernumeraries,
etc."""
175,26,101,"A few figures taken from the article will suggest the enormous capacity
and the perfect convenience of the house.  ""There are 2,531 doors and
7,593 keys; 14 furnaces and grates heat the house; the gaspipes if
connected would form a pipe almost 16 miles long; 9 reservoirs, and two
tanks hold 22,222 gallons of water and distribute their contents
through 22,829 2 - 5 feet of piping; 538 persons have places assigned
wherein to change their attire.  The musicians have a foyer with 100
closets for their instruments."""
175,26,102,"The author remarks of his visit to the Opera House that it ""was almost
as bewildering as it was agreeable.  Giant stairways and colossal
halls, huge frescoes and enormous mirrors, gold and marble, satin and
velvet, met the eye at every turn."""
175,26,103,"In a recent letter Mr. Andre Castaigne, whose remarkable pictures
illustrate the text, speaks of a river or lake under the Opera House
and mentions the fact that there are now also three metropolitan
railway tunnels, one on top of the other."

345,1,1,"_5 May._ -  - I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In
the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight."
345,1,2,"When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious
strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed
them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and
studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was
massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
of the dark openings."
345,1,3,"I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell
or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark
window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The
time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon
me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a
customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to
explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's
clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor -  - for just before leaving
London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a
full - blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I
expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt
in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the
pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake
and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to
wait the coming of the morning."
345,1,4,"Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching
behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming
light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise
of long disuse, and the great door swung back."
345,1,5,"Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white
moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck
of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver
lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly
gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation: -  -"
345,1,6,"""Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!"" He made no
motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his
gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that
I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and
holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,
an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
ice -  - more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said: -  -"
345,1,7,"""Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the
happiness you bring!"" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to
that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that
for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was
speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively: -  -"
345,1,8,"""Count Dracula?"" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied: -  -"
345,1,9,"""I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;
the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest."" As he was
speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I
protested but he insisted: -  -"
345,1,10,"""Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not
available. Let me see to your comfort myself."" He insisted on carrying
my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and
along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced
to see within a well - lit room in which a table was spread for supper,
and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
flamed and flared."
345,1,11,"The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit
by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing
through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a
welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
another log fire, -  - also added to but lately, for the top logs were
fresh -  - which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself
left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the
door: -  -"
345,1,12,"""You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come
into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared."""
345,1,13,"The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have
dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,
I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty
toilet, I went into the other room."
345,1,14,"I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the
great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of
his hand to the table, and said: -  -"
345,1,15,"""I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse
me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup."""
345,1,16,"I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.
He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed
it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of
pleasure."
345,1,17,"""I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant
sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in
whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy
and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is
discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall
be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take
your instructions in all matters."""
345,1,18,"The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I
fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese
and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was
my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many
questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had
experienced."
345,1,19,"By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn
up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,
at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an
opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked
physiognomy."
345,1,20,"His face was a strong -  - a very strong -  - aquiline, with high bridge of the
thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and
hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His
eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I
could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
cruel - looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor."
345,1,21,"Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather
coarse -  - broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in
the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp
point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not
repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a
horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could
not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a
grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his
protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the
window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a
strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from
down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes
gleamed, and he said: -  -"
345,1,22,"""Listen to them -  - the children of the night. What music they make!""
Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
added: -  -"
345,1,23,"""Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
hunter."" Then he rose and said: -  -"
345,1,24,"""But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to - morrow you
shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;
so sleep well and dream well!"" With a courteous bow, he opened for me
himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom...."
345,1,25,"I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,
which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the
sake of those dear to me!"
345,1,26,*       *       *       *       *
345,1,27,"_7 May._ -  - It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the
last twenty - four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had
supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the
pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which
was written: -  -"
345,1,28,"""I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me. -  - D."" I set to and
enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I
might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.
There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service
is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.
The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,
though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,
but there they were worn and frayed and moth - eaten. But still in none of
the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my
table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I
could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant
anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
Some time after I had finished my meal -  - I do not know whether to call it
breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had
it -  - I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about
the castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was
absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing
materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of
library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked."
345,1,29,"In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English
books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines
and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books
were of the most varied kind -  - history, geography, politics, political
economy, botany, geology, law -  - all relating to England and English life
and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the
London Directory, the ""Red"" and ""Blue"" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the
Army and Navy Lists, and -  - it somehow gladdened my heart to see it -  - the
Law List."
345,1,30,"Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count
entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good
night's rest. Then he went on: -  -"
345,1,31,"""I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that
will interest you. These companions"" -  - and he laid his hand on some of
the books -  - ""have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours
of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to
know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of
your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.
To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak."""
345,1,32,"""But, Count,"" I said, ""you know and speak English thoroughly!"" He bowed
gravely."
345,1,33,"""I thank you, my friend, for your all too - flattering estimate, but yet I
fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know
the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them."""
345,1,34,"""Indeed,"" I said, ""you speak excellently."""
345,1,35,"""Not so,"" he answered. ""Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your
London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not
enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,
and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men
know him not -  - and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am
like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his
speaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long
master that I would be master still -  - or at least that none other should
be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You
shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may
learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make
error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be
away so long to - day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many
important affairs in hand."""
345,1,36,"Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might
come into that room when I chose. He answered: ""Yes, certainly,"" and
added: -  -"
345,1,37,"""You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are
locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that
all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with
my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand."" I said I was sure of
this, and then he went on: -  -"
345,1,38,"""We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are
not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from
what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of
what strange things there may be."""
345,1,39,"This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to
talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding
things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.
Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most
frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked
him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for
instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue
flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a
certain night of the year -  - last night, in fact, when all evil spirits
are supposed to have unchecked sway -  - a blue flame is seen over any place
where treasure has been concealed. ""That treasure has been hidden,"" he
went on, ""in the region through which you came last night, there can be
but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil
in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the
Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out
to meet them -  - men and women, the aged and the children too -  - and waited
their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep
destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader
was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been
sheltered in the friendly soil."""
345,1,40,"""But how,"" said I, ""can it have remained so long undiscovered, when
there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?""
The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,
sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered: -  -"
345,1,41,"""Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only
appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he
can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he
would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who
marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to
find these places again?"""
345,1,42,"""There you are right,"" I said. ""I know no more than the dead where even
to look for them."" Then we drifted into other matters."
345,1,43,"""Come,"" he said at last, ""tell me of London and of the house which you
have procured for me."" With an apology for my remissness, I went into my
own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in
order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I
passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit
in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,
reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When I
came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I
went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in
everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its
surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the
subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much
more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered: -  -"
345,1,44,"""Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there
I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan -  - nay, pardon me, I
fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first -  - my friend
Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be
in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my
other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!"""
345,1,45,"We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the
necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to
Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a
place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I
inscribe here: -  -"
345,1,46,"""At Purfleet, on a by - road, I came across just such a place as seemed to
be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place
was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,
built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of
years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with
rust."
345,1,47,"""The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre
Face_, as the house is four - sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of
the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by
the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which
make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark - looking pond or
small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and
flows away in a fair - sized stream. The house is very large and of all
periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone
immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with
iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or
church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading
to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from
various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling
way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must
be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very
large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic
asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds."""
345,1,48,"When I had finished, he said: -  -"
345,1,49,"""I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to
live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a
day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice
also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love
not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not
gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;
and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not
attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the
shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken
battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would
be alone with my thoughts when I may."" Somehow his words and his look
did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his
smile look malignant and saturnine."
345,1,50,"Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers
together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of
the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at
England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in
certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed
that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new
estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the
Yorkshire coast."
345,1,51,"It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. ""Aha!"" he
said; ""still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I
am informed that your supper is ready."" He took my arm, and we went into
the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The
Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from
home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.
After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with
me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour
after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not
say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in
every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified
me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at
the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.
They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to
the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and
tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere
can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up
with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count
Dracula, jumping to his feet, said: -  -"
345,1,52,"""Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so
long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by
us,"" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me."
345,1,53,"I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to
notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the
warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have
written of this day."
345,1,54,*       *       *       *       *
345,1,55,"_8 May._ -  - I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too
diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for
there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I
cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had
never come. It may be that this strange night - existence is telling on
me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I
could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,
and he! -  - I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let
me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and
imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say
at once how I stand -  - or seem to."
345,1,56,"I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could
not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,
and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,
and heard the Count's voice saying to me, ""Good - morning."" I started, for
it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass
covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,
but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's
salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.
This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I
could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in
the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no
sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on
the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague
feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at
the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was
trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half
round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his
eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at
my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which
held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed
so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there."
345,1,57,"""Take care,"" he said, ""take care how you cut yourself. It is more
dangerous than you think in this country."" Then seizing the shaving
glass, he went on: ""And this is the wretched thing that has done the
mischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!"" and
opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung
out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones
of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very
annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch - case or
the bottom of the shaving - pot, which is fortunately of metal."
345,1,58,"When I went into the dining - room, breakfast was prepared; but I could
not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that
as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very
peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I
went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The
view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity
of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A
stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without
touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree
tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and
there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through
the forests."
345,1,59,"But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I
explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and
bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
an available exit."
345,1,60,"The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!"
345,2,0,JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL -  - _continued_
345,2,1,"When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.
I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my
helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a
few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much
as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me
that I was helpless I sat down quietly -  - as quietly as I have ever done
anything in my life -  - and began to think over what was best to be done. I
am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of
one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to
the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it
himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive
me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only
plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,
or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and
shall need, all my brains to get through."
345,2,2,"I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below
shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into
the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making
the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along
thought -  - that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him
through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
dining - room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these
menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.
This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it
must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that
brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it
mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his
hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the
coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the
crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless
that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing
which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there
is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,
a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some
time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my
mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count
Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To - night he may talk of
himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,
however, not to awake his suspicion."
345,2,3,*       *       *       *       *
345,2,4,"_Midnight._ -  - I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few
questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject
wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of
battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he
afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house
and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their
fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said ""we,""
and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put
down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most
fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He
grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great
white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as
though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I
shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of
his race: -  -"
345,2,5,"""We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,
in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from
Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their
Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,
and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the
were - wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found
the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,
till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the
desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as
Attila, whose blood is in these veins?"" He held up his arms. ""Is it a
wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the
Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his
thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when
Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us
here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed
there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were
claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries
was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey - land; ay, and more
than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,
'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly than we
throughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its
warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was
redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the
flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who
was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat
the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that
his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the
Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,
indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and
again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey - land; who,
when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had
to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They
said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants
without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to
conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the
Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for
our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the
Szekelys -  - and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and
their swords -  - can boast a record that mushroom growths like the
Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.
Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and
the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told."""
345,2,6,"It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this
diary seems horribly like the beginning of the ""Arabian Nights,"" for
everything has to break off at cockcrow -  - or like the ghost of Hamlet's
father.)"
345,2,7,*       *       *       *       *
345,2,8,"_12 May._ -  - Let me begin with facts -  - bare, meagre facts, verified by
books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not
confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from
his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the
doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over
books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the
matters I had been examining at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain
method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in
sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me."
345,2,9,"First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I
told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be
wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only
one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate
against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to
ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to
attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case
local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking
solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any
chance mislead him, so he said: -  -"
345,2,10,"""I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under
the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from
London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now
here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have
sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one
resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be
served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,
have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to
seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose
I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or
Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more
ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?"" I answered that
certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of
agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on
instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing
himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by
him without further trouble."
345,2,11,"""But,"" said he, ""I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?"""
345,2,12,"""Of course,"" I replied; and ""such is often done by men of business, who
do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person."""
345,2,13,"""Good!"" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making
consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of
difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded
against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,
and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a
wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or
foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not
evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were
wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had
spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books
available, he suddenly stood up and said: -  -"
345,2,14,"""Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter
Hawkins, or to any other?"" It was with some bitterness in my heart that
I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of
sending letters to anybody."
345,2,15,"""Then write now, my young friend,"" he said, laying a heavy hand on my
shoulder: ""write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will
please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now."""
345,2,16,"""Do you wish me to stay so long?"" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the
thought."
345,2,17,"""I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,
employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,
it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not
stinted. Is it not so?"""
345,2,18,"What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not
mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count
Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I
could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his
mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but
in his own smooth, resistless way: -  -"
345,2,19,"""I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things
other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your
friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting
home to them. Is it not so?"" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of
note - paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign
post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,
with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood
as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for
he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes
now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for
to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he
did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a
book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to
some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his
own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door
had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which
were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for
under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way
I could."
345,2,20,"One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The
Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to
Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,
bankers, Buda - Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just
about to look at them when I saw the door - handle move. I sank back in my
seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and
to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his
hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped
them carefully, and then turning to me, said: -  -"
345,2,21,"""I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this
evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish."" At the door he
turned, and after a moment's pause said: -  -"
345,2,22,"""Let me advise you, my dear young friend -  - nay, let me warn you with all
seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has
many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be
warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then
haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be
safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then"" -  - He finished his
speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were
washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any
dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom
and mystery which seemed closing around me."
345,2,23,*       *       *       *       *
345,2,24,"_Later._ -  - I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no
doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is
not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed -  - I imagine that
my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain."
345,2,25,"When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any
sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out
towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,
inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness
of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in
prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of
the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.
It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all
sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my
terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful
expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as
day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows
in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed
to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I
leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey
below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of
the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The
window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone - mullioned, and though
weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since
the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked
carefully out."
345,2,26,"What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window. I did not
see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had
so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and
somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest
and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to
repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,
_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At
first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the
moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could
be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the
stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus
using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall."
345,2,27,"What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
me; I am in fear -  - in awful fear -  - and there is no escape for me; I am
encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of...."
345,2,28,*       *       *       *       *
345,2,29,"_15 May._ -  - Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.
He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good
deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head
had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without
avail -  - the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I
knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to
explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and
taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had
expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the
stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could
pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the
door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's
room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and
escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs
and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two
small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in
them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth - eaten. At last,
however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it
seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,
and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came
from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door
rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have
again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that
I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right
than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could
see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the
windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter
side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle
was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was
quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or
bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,
impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the
west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged
mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with
mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and
crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle
occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of
comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the
yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to
see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My
lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was
glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place
which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better
than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the
presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I
found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak
table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much
thought and many blushes, her ill - spelt love - letter, and writing in my
diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is
nineteenth century up - to - date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my
senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
which mere ""modernity"" cannot kill."
345,2,30,*       *       *       *       *
345,2,31,"_Later: the Morning of 16 May._ -  - God preserve my sanity, for to this I
am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not
go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it
is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I
can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his
purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way
lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which
have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant
when he made Hamlet say: -  -"
345,2,32,"""My tablets! quick, my tablets!
'Tis meet that I put it down,"" etc.,"
345,2,33,"for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock
had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.
The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me."
345,2,34,"The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens
me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon
me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!"
345,2,35,"When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and
pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count's warning came into my mind,
but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,
and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft
moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom
which refreshed me. I determined not to return to - night to the
gloom - haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat
and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great
couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look
at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for
the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen
asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly
real -  - so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the
morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep."
345,2,36,"I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I
came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,
my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of
dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by
their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming
when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw
no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some
time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline
noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be
almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was
fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes
like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it
in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the
moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something
about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some
deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would
kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some
day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.
They whispered together, and then they all three laughed -  - such a
silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have
come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,
tingling sweetness of water - glasses when played on by a cunning hand.
The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her
on. One said: -  -"
345,2,37,"""Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
begin."" The other added: -  -"
345,2,38,"""He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all."" I lay quiet,
looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.
The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement
of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey - sweet, and sent
the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter
underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood."
345,2,39,"I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under
the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply
gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling
and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining
on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp
teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of
my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she
paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the
skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that
is to tickle it approaches nearer -  - nearer. I could feel the soft,
shivering touch of the lips on the super - sensitive skin of my throat,
and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.
I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited -  - waited with beating
heart."
345,2,40,"But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as
lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his
being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I
saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the
white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with
passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to
the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light
in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell - fire blazed behind them. His
face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;
the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar
of white - hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman
from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating
them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the
wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to
cut through the air and then ring round the room he said: -  -"
345,2,41,"""How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when
I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware
how you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me."" The fair girl,
with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him: -  -"
345,2,42,"""You yourself never loved; you never love!"" On this the other women
joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the
room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure
of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
and said in a soft whisper: -  -"
345,2,43,"""Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it
not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall
kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work
to be done."""
345,2,44,"""Are we to have nothing to - night?"" said one of them, with a low laugh,
as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which
moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he
nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my
ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a
half - smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with
horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful
bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me
without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the
dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away."
345,2,45,"Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious."
345,3,0,JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL -  - _continued_
345,3,1,"I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must
have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were
certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am
rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and
many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been
evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or
another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one
thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed
me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I
am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not
have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this
room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of
sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who
were -  - who _are_ -  - waiting to suck my blood."
345,3,2,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,3,"_18 May._ -  - I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for
I _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the
stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the
jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt
of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise."
345,3,4,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,5,"_19 May._ -  - I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in
the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here
was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,
another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the
letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at
Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I
am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his
suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and
that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to
prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a
chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained
to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would
ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much
impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would
be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and
then said: -  -"
345,3,6,"""The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June
29."""
345,3,7,I know now the span of my life. God help me!
345,3,8,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,9,"_28 May._ -  - There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to
send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are
encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of
them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though
allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands
of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and
call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,
save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany
tongue."
345,3,10,"I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them
posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin
acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many
signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could
their spoken language...."
345,3,11,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,12,"I have written the letters. Mina's is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.
Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,
but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and
frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the
letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the
extent of my knowledge...."
345,3,13,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,14,"I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window
with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The
man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them
in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to
read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here...."
345,3,15,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,16,"The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest
voice as he opened two letters: -  -"
345,3,17,"""The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they
come, I shall, of course, take care. See!"" -  - he must have looked at
it -  - ""one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other"" -  - here
he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and
the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly -  - ""the
other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is
not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us."" And he calmly held letter
and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he
went on: -  -"
345,3,18,"""The letter to Hawkins -  - that I shall, of course, send on, since it is
yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that
unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?"" He held
out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean
envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When
he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later
I went over and tried it, and the door was locked."
345,3,19,"When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his
coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very
courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been
sleeping, he said: -  -"
345,3,20,"""So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I
may not have the pleasure to talk to - night, since there are many labours
to me; but you will sleep, I pray."" I passed to my room and went to bed,
and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms."
345,3,21,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,22,"_31 May._ -  - This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself
with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so
that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a
surprise, again a shock!"
345,3,23,"Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered
awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my
portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes."
345,3,24,"The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and
rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new
scheme of villainy...."
345,3,25,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,26,"_17 June._ -  - This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed
cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding
and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.
With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great
leiter - wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of
each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail - studded belt, dirty
sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I
ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the
main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a
shock: my door was fastened on the outside."
345,3,27,"Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me
stupidly and pointed, but just then the ""hetman"" of the Szgany came out,
and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they
laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised
entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.
The leiter - wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick
rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks
handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When
they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the
yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on
it for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I
heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance."
345,3,28,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,29,"_24 June, before morning._ -  - Last night the Count left me early, and
locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the
winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I
thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.
The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of
some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far - away muffled sound
as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some
ruthless villainy."
345,3,30,"I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw
something coming out of the Count's window. I drew back and watched
carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to
find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst
travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I
had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,
and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will
allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave
evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own
letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local
people be attributed to me."
345,3,31,"It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up
here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which
is even a criminal's right and consolation."
345,3,32,"I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time sat
doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some
quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were
like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in
clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of
soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the
embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more
fully the aërial gambolling."
345,3,33,"Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far
below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to
ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to
the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to
awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,
and my half - remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I
was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the
moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom
beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom
shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my
senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were
becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the
three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat
safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp
was burning brightly."
345,3,34,"When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the
Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then
there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a
beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and
could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried."
345,3,35,"As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without -  - the agonised cry of a
woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between
the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning
against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she
threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace: -  -"
345,3,36,"""Monster, give me my child!"""
345,3,37,"She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same
words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her
breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant
emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see
her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door."
345,3,38,"Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the
Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be
answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes
had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent - up dam when liberated,
through the wide entrance into the courtyard."
345,3,39,"There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but
short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips."
345,3,40,"I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and
she was better dead."
345,3,41,"What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful
thing of night and gloom and fear?"
345,3,42,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,43,"_25 June, morning._ -  - No man knows till he has suffered from the night
how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the
sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great
gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me
as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as
if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must
take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last
night one of my post - dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal
series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the
earth."
345,3,44,Let me not think of it. Action!
345,3,45,"It has always been at night - time that I have been molested or
threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the
Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that
he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!
But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me."
345,3,46,"Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone
why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his
window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The
chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk
it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man's death is not a
calf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me
in my task! Good - bye, Mina, if I fail; good - bye, my faithful friend and
second father; good - bye, all, and last of all Mina!"
345,3,47,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,48,"_Same day, later._ -  - I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have
come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I
went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south
side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs
around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,
and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I
took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down
once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would
not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty
well the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for it
as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did
not feel dizzy -  - I suppose I was too excited -  - and the time seemed
ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window - sill and
trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when
I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked
around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.
The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which
seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same
style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked
for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it
anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one
corner -  - gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and
Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as
though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was
less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,
some jewelled, but all of them old and stained."
345,3,49,"At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I
could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or
all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone
passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,
minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit
by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,
tunnel - like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the
odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell
grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood
ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently
been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were
steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and
the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been
brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for
any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of
the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the
vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to
my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments
of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a
discovery."
345,3,50,"There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a
pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I
could not say which -  - for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
glassiness of death -  - and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all
their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of
movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,
and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain
there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.
By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.
I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw
the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,
though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and
leaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle
wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried
to think...."
345,3,51,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,52,"_29 June._ -  - To - day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has
taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the
castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,
lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might
destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would
have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared
to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there
till I fell asleep."
345,3,53,"I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can
look as he said: -  -"
345,3,54,"""To - morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful
England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never
meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to - morrow I shall not be
here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the
Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall
bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to
Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle
Dracula."" I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in
connection with such a monster, so asked him point - blank: -  -"
345,3,55,"""Why may I not go to - night?"""
345,3,56,"""Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission."""
345,3,57,"""But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once."" He smiled,
such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick
behind his smoothness. He said: -  -"
345,3,58,"""And your baggage?"""
345,3,59,"""I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time."""
345,3,60,"The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my
eyes, it seemed so real: -  -"
345,3,61,"""You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is
that which rules our _boyars_: 'Welcome the coming; speed the parting
guest.' Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait
in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that
you so suddenly desire it. Come!"" With a stately gravity, he, with the
lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he
stopped."
345,3,62,"""Hark!"""
345,3,63,"Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the
sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great
orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause
of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back
the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it
open."
345,3,64,"To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I
looked all round, but could see no key of any kind."
345,3,65,"As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder
and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt - clawed
feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that
to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such
allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door
continued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.
Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my
doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There
was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and
as a last chance I cried out: -  -"
345,3,66,"""Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!"" and covered my face with my
hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his
powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged
and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places."
345,3,67,"In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went
to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand
to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that
Judas in hell might be proud of."
345,3,68,"When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a
whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears
deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count: -  -"
345,3,69,"""Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have
patience! To - night is mine. To - morrow night is yours!"" There was a low,
sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw
without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they
all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away."
345,3,70,"I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near
the end? To - morrow! to - morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am
dear!"
345,3,71,*       *       *       *       *
345,3,72,"_30 June, morning._ -  - These may be the last words I ever write in this
diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself
on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me
ready."
345,3,73,"At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
had come. Then came the welcome cock - crow, and I felt that I was safe.
With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen
that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands
that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the
massive bolts."
345,3,74,"But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at
the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the
Count."
345,3,75,"Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I
determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's
room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of
evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled
down the wall, as before, into the Count's room. It was empty, but that
was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold
remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding
stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well
enough where to find the monster I sought."
345,3,76,"The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid
was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their
places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so
I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw
something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,
but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair
and moustache were changed to dark iron - grey; the cheeks were fuller,
and the white skin seemed ruby - red underneath; the mouth was redder than
ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the
corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,
burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches
underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were
simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his
repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in
me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The
coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those
horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the
key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile
on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I
was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come
he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and
create a new and ever - widening circle of semi - demons to batten on the
helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me
to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,
but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the
cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the
hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full
upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to
paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,
merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my
hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade
caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid
thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,
blood - stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its
own in the nethermost hell."
345,3,77,"I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed
on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I
waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming
closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the
cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had
spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which
contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's
room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the
key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must
have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of
the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and
dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to
run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;
but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the
door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from
the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was
hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing
round me more closely."
345,3,78,"As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet
and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,
with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the
box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again
along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them."
345,3,79,"The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key
in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and
shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt."
345,3,80,"Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the
distance."
345,3,81,"I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,
and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!"
345,3,82,"I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall
farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with
me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place."
345,3,83,"And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away
from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his
children still walk with earthly feet!"
345,3,84,"At least God's mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the
precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep -  - as a man.
Good - bye, all! Mina!"

345,3,87,"""_9 May._"
345,3,88,"""My dearest Lucy, -  -"
345,3,89,"""Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed
with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard
lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies, and I have
been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall
be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I
can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for
him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He
and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a
stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I
shall keep a diary in the same way. I don't mean one of those
two - pages - to - the - week - with - Sunday - squeezed - in - a - corner diaries, but a
sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not
suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it
anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try
to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with
a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little
plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan
from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I
am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange
countries. I wonder if we -  - I mean Jonathan and I -  - shall ever see them
together. There is the ten o'clock bell ringing. Good - bye."

345,3,95,"""_Wednesday_."
345,3,96,"""My dearest Mina, -  -"
345,3,97,"""I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I
wrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your
_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing
to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal
to picture - galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the
tall, curly - haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the
last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.
Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well
together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some
time ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already
engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well
off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He
is only nine - and - twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under
his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to
see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men
I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I
can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has
a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to
read one's thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter
myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do
you ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not
a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you
have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological
study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient
interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a
bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.
There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
since we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and
laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like
to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn't you guess? I love him. I am blushing
as I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in
words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that
does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire
undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.
I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,
or I should tear up the letter, and I don't want to stop, for I _do_ so
want to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all
that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good - night. Bless me in your
prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness."

345,3,103,"""My dearest Mina, -  -"
345,3,104,"""Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so
nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy."
345,3,105,"""My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.
Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a
proposal till to - day, not a real proposal, and to - day I have had three.
Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn't it awful! I feel sorry,
really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so
happy that I don't know what to do with myself. And three proposals!
But, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of the girls, or they would be
getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured
and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and
are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can
despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep
it a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You
will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell
Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything -  - don't you think
so, dear? -  - and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to
be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always
quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just
before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic - asylum
man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool
outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling
himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he
almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do
when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept
playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to
me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,
though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to
help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I
did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute
and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if
I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,
and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one
else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my
confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was
free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to
tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he
stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my
hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever
wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can't
help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being
proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at
all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know
loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken - hearted, and to
know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing
quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so
miserable, though I am so happy."
345,3,106,"""_Evening._"
345,3,107,"""Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left
off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two
came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and
he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he
has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise
with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her
ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that
we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now
what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I
don't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never
told any, and yet -  -  -  -  My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.
Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl
alone. No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I
helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you
beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang -  - that is to say,
he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well
educated and has exquisite manners -  - but he found out that it amused me
to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there
was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my
dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he
has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall
ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never
heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked
as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was
very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly: -  -"
345,3,108,"""'Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your
little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you
will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won't
you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road
together, driving in double harness?'"
345,3,109,"""Well, he did look so good - humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem
half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as
lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I
wasn't broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in
a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so
on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He
really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help
feeling a bit serious too -  - I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid
flirt -  - though I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was
number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he
began pouring out a perfect torrent of love - making, laying his very
heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall
never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,
because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face
which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of
manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free: -  -"
345,3,110,"""'Lucy, you are an honest - hearted girl, I know. I should not be here
speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right
through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow
to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is
I'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again, but will be, if you will
let me, a very faithful friend.'"
345,3,111,"""My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great - hearted, true
gentleman. I burst into tears -  - I am afraid, my dear, you will think
this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one -  - and I really felt very
badly. Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want
her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say
it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into
Mr. Morris's brave eyes, and I told him out straight: -  -"
345,3,112,"""'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he
even loves me.' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a
light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine -  - I
think I put them into his -  - and said in a hearty way: -  -"
345,3,113,"""'That's my brave girl. It's better worth being late for a chance of
winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don't
cry, my dear. If it's for me, I'm a hard nut to crack; and I take it
standing up. If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd
better look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me. Little girl,
your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's rarer than a
lover; it's more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I'm going to have a pretty
lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won't you give me one kiss?
It'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you
know, if you like, for that other good fellow -  - he must be a good fellow,
my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him -  - hasn't spoken
yet.' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and
noble, too, to a rival -  - wasn't it? -  - and he so sad; so I leant over and
kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down
into my face -  - I am afraid I was blushing very much -  - he said: -  -"
345,3,114,"""'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these
things don't make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet
honesty to me, and good - bye.' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,
went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a
quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like
that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would
worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free -  - only
I don't want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I
cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I
don't wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy."
345,3,115,"""Ever your loving"
345,3,116,"""LUCY."
345,3,117,"""P.S. -  - Oh, about number Three -  - I needn't tell you of number Three, need
I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his
coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was
kissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don't know what I have done to
deserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not
ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a
lover, such a husband, and such a friend."

345,3,121,"_25 May._ -  - Ebb tide in appetite to - day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so
diary instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty
feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth
the doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was
work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has
afforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am
determined to understand him as well as I can. To - day I seemed to get
nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery."
345,3,122,"I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making
myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing
it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep
him to the point of his madness -  - a thing which I avoid with the patients
as I would the mouth of hell."

morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I

dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution
is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of
on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is
balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed
point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of

345,4,1,"_24 July. Whitby._ -  - Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and
lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in
which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the
Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the
harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the
view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is
beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land
on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to
see down. The houses of the old town -  - the side away from us -  - are all
red - roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the
pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby
Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of
""Marmion,"" where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble
ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is
a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and
the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in
Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the
harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness
stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that
part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches
out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside
them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long
looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and
sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my
book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are
sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
talk."
345,4,2,"The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in
the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea - wall runs along outside
of it. On the near side, the sea - wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,
and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a
narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens."
345,4,3,"It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between
banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this
side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of
which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is
lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he
is coming this way...."
345,4,4,"He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all
gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is
nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing
fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical
person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady
at the abbey he said very brusquely: -  -"
345,4,5,"""I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.
Mind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn't in
my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like,
but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet - folks from York and
Leeds that be always eatin' cured herrin's an' drinkin' tea an' lookin'
out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel' who'd be
bothered tellin' lies to them -  - even the newspapers, which is full of
fool - talk."" I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting
things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about
the whale - fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin
when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said: -  -"
345,4,6,"""I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand - daughter doesn't like
to be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to
crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of 'em; an', miss, I lack
belly - timber sairly by the clock."""
345,4,7,"He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down
the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from
the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them -  - I do not know how
many -  - and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that
a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally
have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went
out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did
not go. They will be home by this."
345,4,8,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,9,"_1 August._ -  - I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most
interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come
and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think
must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit
anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can't out - argue them he bullies
them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy
was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a
beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did
not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.
She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her
on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but
gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,
and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it
and put it down: -  -"
345,4,10,"""It be all fool - talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that's what it be, an'
nowt else. These bans an' wafts an' boh - ghosts an' barguests an' bogles
an' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an' dizzy women
a - belderin'. They be nowt but air - blebs. They, an' all grims an' signs
an' warnin's, be all invented by parsons an' illsome beuk - bodies an'
railway touters to skeer an' scunner hafflin's, an' to get folks to do
somethin' that they don't other incline to. It makes me ireful to think
o' them. Why, it's them that, not content with printin' lies on paper
an' preachin' them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin' them on the
tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
steans, holdin' up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,
is acant -  - simply tumblin' down with the weight o' the lies wrote on
them, 'Here lies the body' or 'Sacred to the memory' wrote on all of
them, an' yet in nigh half of them there bean't no bodies at all; an'
the memories of them bean't cared a pinch of snuff about, much less
sacred. Lies all of them, nothin' but lies of one kind or another! My
gog, but it'll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they
come tumblin' up in their death - sarks, all jouped together an' tryin' to
drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them
trimmlin' and ditherin', with their hands that dozzened an' slippy from
lyin' in the sea that they can't even keep their grup o' them."""
345,4,11,"I could see from the old fellow's self - satisfied air and the way in
which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was
""showing off,"" so I put in a word to keep him going: -  -"
345,4,12,"""Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious. Surely these tombstones are not
all wrong?"""
345,4,13,"""Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin' where they make
out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm - bowl be
like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now
look you here; you come here a stranger, an' you see this kirk - garth."" I
nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite
understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.
He went on: ""And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be
happed here, snod an' snog?"" I assented again. ""Then that be just where
the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay - beds that be toom as
old Dun's 'bacca - box on Friday night."" He nudged one of his companions,
and they all laughed. ""And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at
that one, the aftest abaft the bier - bank: read it!"" I went over and
read: -  -"
345,4,14,"""Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of
Andres, April, 1854, æt. 30."" When I came back Mr. Swales went on: -  -"
345,4,15,"""Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast
of Andres! an' you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a
dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above"" -  - he pointed
northwards -  - ""or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the
steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small - print of
the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey -  - I knew his father, lost in
the _Lively_ off Greenland in '20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the
same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year
later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned
in the Gulf of Finland in '50. Do ye think that all these men will have
to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums
aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they'd be jommlin' an'
jostlin' one another that way that it 'ud be like a fight up on the ice
in the old days, when we'd be at one another from daylight to dark, an'
tryin' to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis."" This was
evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his
cronies joined in with gusto."
345,4,16,"""But,"" I said, ""surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the
assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to
take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think
that will be really necessary?"""
345,4,17,"""Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!"""
345,4,18,"""To please their relatives, I suppose."""
345,4,19,"""To please their relatives, you suppose!"" This he said with intense
scorn. ""How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote
over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?"" He
pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on
which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. ""Read the
lies on that thruff - stean,"" he said. The letters were upside down to me
from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over
and read: -  -"
345,4,20,"""Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a
glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly
beloved son. 'He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.'
Really, Mr. Swales, I don't see anything very funny in that!"" She spoke
her comment very gravely and somewhat severely."
345,4,21,"""Ye don't see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that's because ye don't gawm the
sorrowin' mother was a hell - cat that hated him because he was
acrewk'd -  - a regular lamiter he was -  - an' he hated her so that he
committed suicide in order that she mightn't get an insurance she put on
his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that
they had for scarin' the crows with. 'Twarn't for crows then, for it
brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That's the way he fell off the
rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I've often heard him
say masel' that he hoped he'd go to hell, for his mother was so pious
that she'd be sure to go to heaven, an' he didn't want to addle where
she was. Now isn't that stean at any rate"" -  - he hammered it with his
stick as he spoke -  - ""a pack of lies? and won't it make Gabriel keckle
when Geordie comes pantin' up the grees with the tombstean balanced on
his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!"""
345,4,22,"I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she
said, rising up: -  -"
345,4,23,"""Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot
leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a
suicide."""
345,4,24,"""That won't harm ye, my pretty; an' it may make poor Geordie gladsome to
have so trim a lass sittin' on his lap. That won't hurt ye. Why, I've
sat here off an' on for nigh twenty years past, an' it hasn't done me
no harm. Don't ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn' lie
there either! It'll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the
tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble - field.
There's the clock, an' I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!"" And off
he hobbled."
345,4,25,"Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and
their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart - sick, for I
haven't heard from Jonathan for a whole month."
345,4,26,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,27,"_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no
letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.
The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the
town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;
they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my
left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next
the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind
me, and there is a clatter of a donkey's hoofs up the paved road below.
The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further
along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.
Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them
both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he
were here."
345,4,28,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,4,29,"_5 June._ -  - The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to
understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;
selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the
object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,
but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of
animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I
sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd
sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a
quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he
did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in
simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: ""May I have
three days? I shall clear them away."" Of course, I said that would do. I
must watch him."
345,4,30,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,31,"_18 June._ -  - He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several
very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and
the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he
has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his
room."
345,4,32,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,33,"_1 July._ -  - His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his
flies, and to - day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked
very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all
events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time
as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a
horrid blow - fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,
he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger
and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his
mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it
was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and
gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must
watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem
in his mind, for he keeps a little note - book in which he is always
jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of
figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the
totals added in batches again, as though he were ""focussing"" some
account, as the auditors put it."
345,4,34,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,35,"_8 July._ -  - There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in
my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,
unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I
might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except
that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has
managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means
of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that
do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by
tempting them with his food."
345,4,36,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,37,"_19 July._ -  - We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of
sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came
in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour -  - a very,
very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked
him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and
bearing: -  -"
345,4,38,"""A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,
and teach, and feed -  - and feed -  - and feed!"" I was not unprepared for this
request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and
vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows
should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so
I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a
cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered: -  -"
345,4,39,"""Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should
refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?"" I shook
my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but
that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of
danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant
killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him
with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know
more."
345,4,40,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,41,"_10 p. m._ -  - I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner
brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and
implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.
I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon
he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner
where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early."
345,4,42,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,43,"_20 July._ -  - Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his
rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,
which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his
fly - catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I
looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they
were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.
There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of
blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if
there were anything odd about him during the day."
345,4,44,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,45,"_11 a. m._ -  - The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has
been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. ""My belief is,
doctor,"" he said, ""that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took
and ate them raw!"""
345,4,46,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,47,"_11 p. m._ -  - I gave Renfield a strong opiate to - night, enough to make
even him sleep, and took away his pocket - book to look at it. The thought
that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to
invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous
(life - eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he
can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He
gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then
wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later
steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It
might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at
vivisection, and yet look at its results to - day! Why not advance science
in its most difficult and vital aspect -  - the knowledge of the brain? Had
I even the secret of one such mind -  - did I hold the key to the fancy of
even one lunatic -  - I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch
compared with which Burdon - Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's
brain - knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient
cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good
cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an
exceptional brain, congenitally?"
345,4,48,"How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I
wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has
closed the account most accurately, and to - day begun a new record. How
many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?"
345,4,49,"To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,
and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great
Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to
profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be
angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on
hopeless and work. Work! work!"
345,4,50,"If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there -  - a
good, unselfish cause to make me work -  - that would be indeed happiness."
345,4,51,_Mina Murray's Journal._
345,4,52,"_26 July._ -  - I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it
is like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time. And
there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it
different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I
had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but
yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from
him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed
had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,
and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;
I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,
although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in
her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided
that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has
got an idea that sleep - walkers always go out on roofs of houses and
along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over
with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is
naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy's
father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress
himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the
autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is
to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan
and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to
make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood -  - he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only
son of Lord Godalming -  - is coming up here very shortly -  - as soon as he can
leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is
counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat
on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it
is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he
arrives."
345,4,53,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,54,"_27 July._ -  - No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,
though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if
it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I
am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so
hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually
being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and
wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy's health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been
suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously
ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch
her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely
rose - pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she had. I pray it will
all last."
345,4,55,*       *       *       *       *
345,4,56,"_3 August._ -  - Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to
Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He
surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but
somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is
his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in
her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her
which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching
me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
searching for the key."
345,4,57,"_6 August._ -  - Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting
dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should
feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last
letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable
than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and
the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and
learn the weather signs. To - day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is
hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey -  - except
the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;
grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the
grey sea, into which the sand - points stretch like grey fingers. The sea
is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,
muffled in the sea - mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey
mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and
there is a ""brool"" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.
Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in
the mist, and seem ""men like trees walking."" The fishing - boats are
racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into
the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is
making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that
he wants to talk...."
345,4,58,"I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat
down beside me, he said in a very gentle way: -  -"
345,4,59,"""I want to say something to you, miss."" I could see he was not at ease,
so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine: -  -"
345,4,60,"""I'm afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked
things I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;
but I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone. We
aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok - hooal, don't
altogether like to think of it, and we don't want to feel scart of it;
an' that's why I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my
own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a
bit; only I don't want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at
hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to
expect; and I'm so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin' his
scythe. Ye see, I can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at
once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of
Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don't ye dooal an' greet, my
deary!"" -  - for he saw that I was crying -  - ""if he should come this very
night I'd not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a
waitin' for somethin' else than what we're doin'; and death be all that
we can rightly depend on. But I'm content, for it's comin' to me, my
deary, and comin' quick. It may be comin' while we be lookin' and
wonderin'. Maybe it's in that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with
it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!"" he
cried suddenly. ""There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont
that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It's in the
air; I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call
comes!"" He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth
moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes' silence, he got
up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good - bye, and hobbled
off. It all touched me, and upset me very much."
345,4,61,"I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy - glass under his
arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time
kept looking at a strange ship."
345,4,62,"""I can't make her out,"" he said; ""she's a Russian, by the look of her;
but she's knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn't know her mind
a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can't decide whether to
run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is
steered mighty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel;
changes about with every puff of wind. We'll hear more of her before
this time to - morrow."""
345,5,0,"CUTTING FROM ""THE DAILYGRAPH,"" 8 AUGUST"
345,5,1,(_Pasted in Mina Murray's Journal._)
345,5,2,From a Correspondent.
345,5,3,_Whitby_.
345,5,4,"One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had
been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
body of holiday - makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,
Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in
the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made
trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
""tripping"" both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff
churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of
""mares' - tails"" high in the sky to the north - west. The wind was then
blowing from the south - west in the mild degree which in barometrical
language is ranked ""No. 2: light breeze."" The coastguard on duty at once
made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has
kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic
manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very
beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly - coloured clouds, that
there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black
mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its
downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset - colour -  - flame,
purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and
there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all
sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The
experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
sketches of the ""Prelude to the Great Storm"" will grace the R. A. and R.
I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and
there that his ""cobble"" or his ""mule,"" as they term the different
classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on
the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There
were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,
which usually ""hug"" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but
few fishing - boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign
schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The
foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for
comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal
her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she
was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating
swell of the sea,"
345,5,5,"""As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."""
345,5,6,"Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite
oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep
inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the
band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the
great harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a
strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
carry a strange, faint, hollow booming."
345,5,7,"Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the
time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,
the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in
growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes
the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.
White - crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the
shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept
the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier
of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such
force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,
or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary
to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the
fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to
the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea - fog came
drifting inland -  - white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,
so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were
touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many
a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea - mist swept by. At times the mist
cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the
lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals
of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock
of the footsteps of the storm."
345,5,8,"Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of
absorbing interest -  - the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to
snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing - boat, with
a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again
the white wings of a storm - tossed sea - bird. On the summit of the East
Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been
tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in
the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.
Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing - boat,
with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance
of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the
piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of
joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed
to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush."
345,5,9,"Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner
with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,
and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the
port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
speed that, in the words of one old salt, ""she must fetch up somewhere,
if it was only in hell."" Then came another rush of sea - fog, greater than
any hitherto -  - a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things
like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,
for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the
booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder
than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north - east, and the remnant
of the sea - fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between
the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,
swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a
shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great
awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had
found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,
all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The
schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on
that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
storms into the south - east corner of the pier jutting under the East
Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier."
345,5,10,"There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
""top - hammer"" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant
the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as
if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat
tombstones -  - ""thruff - steans"" or ""through - stones,"" as they call them in
the Whitby vernacular -  - actually project over where the sustaining cliff
has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed
intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight."
345,5,11,"It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as
all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were
out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern
side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the
first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring
the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the
light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and
when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at
once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general
curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way
round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your
correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.
When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,
whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the
courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted
to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman
whilst actually lashed to the wheel."
345,5,12,"It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for
not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened
by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between
the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it
was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by
the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but
the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of
the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he
was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the
state of things, and a doctor -  - Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot
Place -  - who came immediately after me, declared, after making
examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his
pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of
paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said
the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his
teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some
complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot
claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a
derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young
law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already
completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the
statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of
delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say
that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where
he held his honourable watch and ward till death -  - a steadfastness as
noble as that of the young Casabianca -  - and placed in the mortuary to
await inquest."
345,5,13,"Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over
the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further
details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into
harbour in the storm."
345,5,14,_Whitby_
345,5,15,"_9 August._ -  - The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It
turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the
_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
small amount of cargo -  - a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of
7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took
possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,
acting for the charter - party, took formal possession of the ship, and
paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to - day except
the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been
most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with
existing regulations. As the matter is to be a ""nine days' wonder,"" they
are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after
complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which
landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the
S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the
animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;
it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it
was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still
hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a
possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it
is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half - bred
mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found
dead in the roadway opposite to its master's yard. It had been fighting,
and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,
and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw."
345,5,16,*       *       *       *       *
345,5,17,"_Later._ -  - By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been
permitted to look over the log - book of the _Demeter_, which was in order
up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest
except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is
with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to - day produced
at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them
unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for
concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a
rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and
supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that
this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my
statement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the
dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for
me, time being short."

sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only
told him there was _something_, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper

345,5,34,"On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in
an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man
aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering
behind the deck - house, as there was a rain - storm, when he saw a tall,
thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion - way,
and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,
but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.
He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may
spread. To allay it, I shall to - day search entire ship carefully from
stem to stern."

345,5,36,"Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they
evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from
stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such
foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep
them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the
rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left
no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there
were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when
search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but
said nothing."
345,5,37,*       *       *       *       *
345,5,38,"_22 July_. -  - Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with
sails -  - no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.
Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad
weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well."
345,5,39,*       *       *       *       *
345,5,40,"_24 July_. -  - There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,
and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last
night another man lost -  - disappeared. Like the first, he came off his
watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round
robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate
angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do
some violence."

345,5,42,"_28 July_. -  - Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom,
and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly
know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate
volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours' sleep.
Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is
steadier."
345,5,43,*       *       *       *       *
345,5,44,"_29 July_. -  - Another tragedy. Had single watch to - night, as crew too
tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one
except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search,
but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate
and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause."

345,5,46,"_30 July_. -  - Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine,
all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling
me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and
two hands left to work ship."
345,5,47,*       *       *       *       *
345,5,48,"_1 August_. -  - Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in
the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.
Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,
as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible
doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature
seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,
working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are
Russian, he Roumanian."
345,5,49,*       *       *       *       *
345,5,50,"_2 August, midnight_. -  - Woke up from few minutes' sleep by hearing a cry,
seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and
ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on
watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits
of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as
he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and
only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God
seems to have deserted us."
345,5,51,*       *       *       *       *
345,5,52,"_3 August_. -  - At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and
when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran
before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the
mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He
looked wild - eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given
way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my
ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: ""_It_ is here; I know
it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,
and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind
It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the
air."" And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into
space. Then he went on: ""But It is here, and I'll find It. It is in the
hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll unscrew them one by one and
see. You work the helm."" And, with a warning look and his finger on his
lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could
not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool - chest
and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,
raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He can't hurt those
big boxes: they are invoiced as ""clay,"" and to pull them about is as
harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and
write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.
Then, if I can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut
down sails and lie by, and signal for help...."
345,5,53,*       *       *       *       *
345,5,54,"It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate
would come out calmer -  - for I heard him knocking away at something in the
hold, and work is good for him -  - there came up the hatchway a sudden,
startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he
came as if shot from a gun -  - a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and
his face convulsed with fear. ""Save me! save me!"" he cried, and then
looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in
a steady voice he said: ""You had better come too, captain, before it is
too late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me
from Him, and it is all that is left!"" Before I could say a word, or
move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately
threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was
this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has
followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these
horrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?"

sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go
below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in
the dimness of the night I saw It -  - Him! God forgive me, but the mate was
right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a
sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not
leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie
my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with
them I shall tie that which He -  - It! -  - dare not touch; and then, come good
wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am
growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the
face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap
this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,

345,5,58,"Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;
and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now
none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is
simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is
arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk
for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey
steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners
of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as
wishing to follow him to the grave."
345,5,59,"No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much
mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I
believe, be adopted by the town. To - morrow will see the funeral; and so
will end this one more ""mystery of the sea."""
345,5,60,_Mina Murray's Journal._
345,5,61,"_8 August._ -  - Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not
sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
chimney - pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be
like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up
twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and
managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It
is a very strange thing, this sleep - walking, for as soon as her will is
thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her
life."
345,5,62,"Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,
and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,
grim - looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that
topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth
of the harbour -  - like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I
felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,
oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully
anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!"
345,5,63,*       *       *       *       *
345,5,64,"_10 August._ -  - The funeral of the poor sea - captain to - day was most
touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin
was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the
churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst
the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down
again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on
it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.
She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that
her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:
she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if
there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional
cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our
seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,
fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of
fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor
dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so
sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other
people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did
not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men
who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.
The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw
the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would
not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few
yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then
harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a
noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs
bristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war - path. Finally
the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then
took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on
the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the
stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did
not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was
in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,
to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly
fear that she is of too super - sensitive a nature to go through the world
without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to - night, I am sure. The
whole agglomeration of things -  - the ship steered into port by a dead
man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the
touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror -  - will all
afford material for her dreams."
345,5,65,"I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I
shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and
back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep - walking then."
345,6,0,MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL
345,6,1,"_Same day, 11 o'clock p. m._ -  - Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I
had made my diary a duty I should not open it to - night. We had a lovely
walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some
dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,
and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything
except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean
and give us a fresh start. We had a capital ""severe tea"" at Robin Hood's
Bay in a sweet little old - fashioned inn, with a bow - window right over
the seaweed - covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have
shocked the ""New Woman"" with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless
them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was
really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.
The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay
for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I
know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that
some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new
class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how they may be
pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and
breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and
looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her
only in the drawing - room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.
Some of the ""New Women"" writers will some day start an idea that men and
women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or
accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won't condescend in future to
accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make
of it, too! There's some consolation in that. I am so happy to - night,
because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the
corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be
quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him."

345,6,3,"_11 August, 3 a. m._ -  - Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.
I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an
agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....
Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear
upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,
so I could not see Lucy's bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed
was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The
door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her
mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some
clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it
struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her
dreaming intention. Dressing - gown would mean house; dress, outside.
Dressing - gown and dress were both in their places. ""Thank God,"" I said
to myself, ""she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress."" I ran
downstairs and looked in the sitting - room. Not there! Then I looked in
all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever - growing fear
chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It
was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people
of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that
Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what
might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a
big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the
Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North
Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At
the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to
the East Cliff, in the hope or fear -  - I don't know which -  - of seeing Lucy
in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,
driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of
light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see
nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all
around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey
coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as
a sword - cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually
visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for
there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a
half - reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too
quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost
immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind
the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,
whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another
glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the
fish - market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East
Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced
that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's condition. The
time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have
gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with
lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost
to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now
close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There
was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the
half - reclining white figure. I called in fright, ""Lucy! Lucy!"" and
something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face
and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the
entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and
the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in
view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly
that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back
of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living
thing about."
345,6,4,"When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips
were parted, and she was breathing -  - not softly as usual with her, but in
long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every
breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the
collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so
there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I
flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,
for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,
unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to
have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her
throat with a big safety - pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety
and pinched or pricked her with it, for by - and - by, when her breathing
became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I
had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began
very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she
became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing
occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other
reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,
till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised
to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.
Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must
have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking
unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She
trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with
me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we
passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She
stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.
However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there
was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with
mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no
one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet."
345,6,5,"Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw
a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of
us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as
there are here, steep little closes, or ""wynds,"" as they call them in
Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I
should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her
health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation
in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our
feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into
bed. Before falling asleep she asked -  - even implored -  - me not to say a
word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep - walking adventure. I
hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her
mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,
and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted -  - nay,
infallibly would -  - in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do
so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to
my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping
soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea...."
345,6,6,*       *       *       *       *
345,6,7,"_Same day, noon._ -  - All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed
not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not
seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to
notice that my clumsiness with the safety - pin hurt her. Indeed, it might
have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have
pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are
two little red points like pin - pricks, and on the band of her nightdress
was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she
laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it
cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny."
345,6,8,*       *       *       *       *
345,6,9,"_Same day, night._ -  - We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the
sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave
Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the
cliff - path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for
I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had
Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening
we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr
and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she
has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door
and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any
trouble to - night."
345,6,10,*       *       *       *       *
345,6,11,"_12 August._ -  - My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I
was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to
be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed
under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds
chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,
was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of
manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me
and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about
Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded
somewhat, for, though sympathy can't alter facts, it can help to make
them more bearable."
345,6,12,*       *       *       *       *
345,6,13,"_13 August._ -  - Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as
before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,
still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling
aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft
effect of the light over the sea and sky -  - merged together in one great,
silent mystery -  - was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight
flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or
twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,
and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back
from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
She did not stir again all night."
345,6,14,*       *       *       *       *
345,6,15,"_14 August._ -  - On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems
to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to
get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for
dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and
stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low
down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was
thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe
everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and
suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself: -  -"
345,6,16,"""His red eyes again! They are just the same."" It was such an odd
expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I
slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare
at her, and saw that she was in a half - dreamy state, with an odd look on
her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but
followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,
for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red
sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our
seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I
called Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she
was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I
said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went
early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;
I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet
sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home -  - it was then
bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the
Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen -  - I threw a glance
up at our window, and saw Lucy's head leaning out. I thought that
perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and
waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,
the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell
on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against
the side of the window - sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and
by her, seated on the window - sill, was something that looked like a
good - sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,
but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast
asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,
as though to protect it from cold."
345,6,17,"I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the
door is locked and the window securely fastened."
345,6,18,"She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and
there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I
fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it
is."
345,6,19,*       *       *       *       *
345,6,20,"_15 August._ -  - Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and
slept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.
Arthur's father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy
is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on
in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her
very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to
protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got
her death - warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;
her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for
her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be
almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of
the dreadful night of Lucy's sleep - walking."
345,6,21,*       *       *       *       *
345,6,22,"_17 August._ -  - No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to
write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
mother's hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy's
fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys
the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and
she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping
as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at
night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open
window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I
tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to
restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,
painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the
window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may
not be from that unlucky prick of the safety - pin. I looked at her throat
just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the
edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with
red centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the
doctor seeing about them."

night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already
to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan - looking. If she
were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in
gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence
seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I
needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this
very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with
the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said: -  -"
345,6,41,"""My poor little feet didn't make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.
Swales would have told me that it was because I didn't want to wake up
Geordie."" As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she
had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered
look came into her forehead, which Arthur -  - I call him Arthur from her
habit -  - says he loves; and, indeed, I don't wonder that he does. Then she
went on in a half - dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to
herself: -  -"
345,6,42,"""I didn't quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be
here in this spot -  - I don't know why, for I was afraid of something -  - I
don't know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing
through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and
I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling -  - the
whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once -  - as
I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and
dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very
sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking
into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have
heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,
and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an
earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do
it before I felt you."""
345,6,43,"Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I
listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it
better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the
fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very
happy evening together."

me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the

and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if
we were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister's

wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of
what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him
of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as
his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we
knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard
was told by the station - master there that he rushed into the station
shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that
he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the

345,6,55,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,6,56,"_19 August._ -  - Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About
eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when
setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest
in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the
attendant and at times servile; but to - night, the man tells me, he was
quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he
would say was: -  -"
345,6,57,"""I don't want to talk to you: you don't count now; the Master is at
hand."""
345,6,58,"The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has
seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with
homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The
combination is a dreadful one. At nine o'clock I visited him myself. His
attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime
self - feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him
as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that
he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man
are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves
away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created
from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,
if men only knew!"
345,6,59,"For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and
greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict
observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his
eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it
the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to
know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his
bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack - lustre eyes. I thought I
would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to
lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite
his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily: -  -"
345,6,60,"""Bother them all! I don't care a pin about them."""
345,6,61,"""What?"" I said. ""You don't mean to tell me you don't care about
spiders?"" (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note - book is filling
up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically: -  -"
345,6,62,"""The bride - maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;
but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes
that are filled."""
345,6,63,"He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed
all the time I remained with him."
345,6,64,"I am weary to - night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and
how different things might have been. If I don't sleep at once, chloral,
the modern Morpheus -  - C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to let
it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to - night! I have thought of
Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,
to - night shall be sleepless...."
345,6,65,*       *       *       *       *
345,6,66,"_Later._ -  - Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had
lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the
night - watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield
had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is
too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might
work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.
He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his
bed, when he had looked through the observation - trap in the door. His
attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He
ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once
sent up for me. He was only in his night - gear, and cannot be far off.
The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should
go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out
of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn't get through
the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,
and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The
attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt
of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our
grounds from those of the deserted house."
345,6,67,"I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men
immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend
might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,
dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield's figure just
disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the
far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old
ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some
one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest
I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of
bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping
is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not
take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to
him -  - the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him
in. I heard him say: -  -"
345,6,68,"""I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will
reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar
off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass
me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?"""
345,6,69,"He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes
even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a
startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.
He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I
never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I
shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and
his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he
might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any
rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn't get free from the strait - waistcoat
that keeps him restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded
room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are
more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement."
345,6,70,Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time: -  -
345,6,71,"""I shall be patient, Master. It is coming -  - coming -  - coming!"""
345,6,72,"So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this
diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to - night."

345,7,3,"""My dearest Lucy, -  -"
345,7,4,"""I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull
all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I
feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I
knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some
nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,
oh, so thin and pale and weak - looking. All the resolution has gone out
of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his
face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not
remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At
least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some
terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try
to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,
tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I
wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,
and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the
secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear
them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the
next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,
and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved
about, added: 'I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about
anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,
have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes
to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can
treat of.' I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my
poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of
_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I
felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a
cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his
face while he sleeps. He is waking!..."
345,7,5,"""When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something
from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
I saw that amongst them was his note - book, and was going to ask him to
let me look at it -  - for I knew then that I might find some clue to his
trouble -  - but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent
me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.
Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the
note - book, and he said to me very solemnly: -  -"
345,7,6,"""'Wilhelmina' -  - I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has
never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him -  - 'you know,
dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no
secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to
think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it
was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain
fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to
know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.' For, my
dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are
complete. 'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is
the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me
know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to
the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.' He fell
back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I
have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this
afternoon, and am waiting her reply...."

345,7,10,"""Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very
happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he
sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his 'I will' firmly
and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those
words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I
shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities
I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the
chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband -  - oh, Lucy, it
is the first time I have written the words 'my husband' -  - left me alone
with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it
up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon
which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing - wax,
and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it
to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would
be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake
or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,
Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife's_ hand, and said that it
was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go
through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to
have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I
shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the
year."
345,7,11,"""Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the
happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him
except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love
and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,
and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn
pledge between us...."
345,7,12,"""Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because
it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to
me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,
and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that
in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,
please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of
sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must
not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be
_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good - bye, my dear. I shall post this at
once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan
is waking -  - I must attend to my husband!"

345,7,22,"_20 August._ -  - The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has
now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.
For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one
night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to
himself: ""Now I can wait; now I can wait."" The attendant came to tell
me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the
strait - waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone
from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading -  - I might
almost say, ""cringing"" -  - softness. I was satisfied with his present
condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,
but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange
thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking
furtively at them: -  -"
345,7,23,"""They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!"""
345,7,24,"It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated
even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I
do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in
common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has
he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well - being is needful
to him? I must find out later on. To - night he will not speak. Even the
offer of a kitten or even a full - grown cat will not tempt him. He will
only say: ""I don't take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,
and I can wait; I can wait."""
345,7,25,"After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet
until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at
length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted
him so that he swooned into a sort of coma."

escaped before without our help; to - night he shall escape with it. We

subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one
thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in
future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given
orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,
when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul's
body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!

345,7,31,"_Later._ -  - Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the
attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him
and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.
Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me
he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he
would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing
happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught
the patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked
into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and
ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one
seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had
some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and
presently said: -  -"
345,7,32,"""You needn't tie me; I shall go quietly!"" Without trouble we came back
to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall
not forget this night...."

be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I
seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the
change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,
for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so
weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved
when he saw me, and I hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder

worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the
clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling
asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I
did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have
fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This
morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains

asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to
disturb the poor lady's mind about her daughter in her present state of

Hillingham to - morrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in
Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being
alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I
am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I
can after you have seen her. Do not fail!"

345,7,46,"""_2 September._"
345,7,47,"""My dear old fellow, -  -"
345,7,48,"""With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you know at once
that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady
that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with
her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw
her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full
opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship
makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can
bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to
draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have
done and propose doing."
345,7,49,"""I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,
and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew
to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no
doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.
We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we
got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness
amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with
me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,
however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair
with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her
high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to
make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly: -  -"
345,7,50,"""'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.' I reminded her
that a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously
anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that
matter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for
myself, but all for him!' So I am quite free."
345,7,51,"""I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see
the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the
quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord
gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a
slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured
a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative
analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in
itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite
satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a
cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something
mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at
times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but
regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she
used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,
and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where
Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not
returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I
have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of
Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the
world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things
were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your
relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to
your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for
her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal
reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his
wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows
what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher
and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;
and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron
nerve, a temper of the ice - brook, an indomitable resolution,
self - command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the
kindliest and truest heart that beats -  - these form his equipment for the
noble work that he is doing for mankind -  - work both in theory and
practice, for his views are as wide as his all - embracing sympathy. I
tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in
him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra
to - morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not
alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call."

345,7,61,"""My dear Art, -  -"
345,7,62,"""Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and
found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that
we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of
the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of
course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,
but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you
trust to me in the matter, he said: 'You must tell him all you think.
Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not
jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.' I asked
what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had
come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his
return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not
be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his
brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the
time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of
our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for
_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the
smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a
student here. I am to get his report to - morrow if he can possibly make
it. In any case I am to have a letter."
345,7,63,"""Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first
saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the
ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was
very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him
feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard
struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick
look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of
all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite
geniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into
reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation
gently round to his visit, and suavely said: -  -"
345,7,64,"""'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so
much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not
see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a
ghastly pale. To them I say: ""Pouf!""' And he snapped his fingers at me
and went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can
he' -  - and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with
which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a
particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of -  - 'know anything
of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them
back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,
oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the
young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell
themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many
sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to
smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all
to ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but
said: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional
cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have
asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,
that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.
And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go
back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if
there be cause I shall come again. The disease -  - for not to be all well
is a disease -  - interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me
too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.'"
345,7,65,"""As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.
And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust
your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my
dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who
are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and
you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to
come at once to Lucy; so do not be over - anxious unless you hear from
me."""
345,7,66,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,7,67,"_4 September._ -  - Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just
before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew
the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a
run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so
violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five
minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The
attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really
appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the
other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite
understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was
some distance away. It is now after the dinner - hour of the asylum, and
as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,
woe - begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show
something directly. I cannot quite understand it."
345,7,68,*       *       *       *       *
345,7,69,"_Later._ -  - Another change in my patient. At five o'clock I looked in on
him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He
was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture
by making nail - marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of
padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad
conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to
his own room and to have his note - book again. I thought it well to
humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the
sugar of his tea spread out on the window - sill, and is reaping quite a
harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a
box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find
a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any
clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not
rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of
far - away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me: -  -"
345,7,70,"""All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do
it for myself!"" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:
""Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little more
sugar? I think it would be good for me."""
345,7,71,"""And the flies?"" I said."
345,7,72,"""Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like
it."" And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man
as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind."
345,7,73,*       *       *       *       *
345,7,74,"_Midnight._ -  - Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,
whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our
own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As
his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in
the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky
beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul
water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone
building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart
to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from
his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less
frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an
inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual
recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up
quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to
hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight
over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his
fly - box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut
the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised
me, so I asked him: ""Are you not going to keep flies any more?"""
345,7,75,"""No,"" said he; ""I am sick of all that rubbish!"" He certainly is a
wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his
mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue
after all, if we can find why to - day his paroxysms came on at high noon
and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at
periods which affects certain natures -  - as at times the moon does others?
We shall see."

There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.
Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me
professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told
her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to
stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with
myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a
shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weak
condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with

345,7,89,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,7,90,"_7 September._ -  - The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at
Liverpool Street was: -  -"
345,7,91,"""Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?"""
345,7,92,"""No,"" I said. ""I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I
wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be."""
345,7,93,"""Right, my friend,"" he said, ""quite right! Better he not know as yet;
perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he
shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal
with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch
as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen,
too -  - the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why
you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge
in its place, where it may rest -  - where it may gather its kind around it
and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here."" He
touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself
the same way. ""I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall
unfold to you."""
345,7,94,"""Why not now?"" I asked. ""It may do some good; we may arrive at some
decision."" He stopped and looked at me, and said: -  -"
345,7,95,"""My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has
ripened -  - while the milk of its mother - earth is in him, and the sunshine
has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the
ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,
and say to you: 'Look! he's good corn; he will make good crop when the
time comes.'"" I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply
he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as
he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: ""The good husbandman tell
you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the
good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for
the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of
the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,
and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,
there's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell."" He broke
off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very
gravely: -  -"
345,7,96,"""You were always a careful student, and your case - book was ever more
full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and
I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that
knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this
case of our dear miss is one that may be -  - mind, I say _may be_ -  - of such
interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the
beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too
small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We
learn from failure, not from success!"""
345,7,97,"When I described Lucy's symptoms -  - the same as before, but infinitely
more marked -  - he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a
bag in which were many instruments and drugs, ""the ghastly paraphernalia
of our beneficial trade,"" as he once called, in one of his lectures, the
equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,
Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I
expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained
that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case
where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some
cause or other, the things not personal -  - even the terrible change in her
daughter to whom she is so attached -  - do not seem to reach her. It is
something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an
envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that
which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered
selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice
of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have
knowledge of."
345,7,98,"I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down
a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness
more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that
I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were
shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I
was horrified when I saw her to - day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the
red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of
her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or
hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged
till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not
seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then
Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The
instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to
the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and
closed the door. ""My God!"" he said; ""this is dreadful. There is no time
to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's
action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is
it you or me?"""
345,7,99,"""I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me."""
345,7,100,"""Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared."""
345,7,101,"I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at
the hall - door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the
door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in
an eager whisper: -  -"
345,7,102,"""Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and
have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for
myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,
sir, for coming."" When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had
been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in
his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which
seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to
him gravely as he held out his hand: -  -"
345,7,103,"""Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is
bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that."" For he
suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. ""You are to
help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your
best help."""
345,7,104,"""What can I do?"" asked Arthur hoarsely. ""Tell me, and I shall do it. My
life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for
her."" The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old
knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer: -  -"
345,7,105,"""My young sir, I do not ask so much as that -  - not the last!"""
345,7,106,"""What shall I do?"" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. ""Come!""
he said. ""You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than
me, better than my friend John."" Arthur looked bewildered, and the
Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way: -  -"
345,7,107,"""Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have
or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform
what we call transfusion of blood -  - to transfer from full veins of one to
the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is
the more young and strong than me"" -  - here Arthur took my hand and wrung
it hard in silence -  - ""but, now you are here, you are more good than us,
old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not
so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!"" Arthur turned to him
and said: -  -"
345,7,108,"""If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would
understand -  -  -  - """
345,7,109,"He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice."
345,7,110,"""Good boy!"" said Van Helsing. ""In the not - so - far - off you will be happy
that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You
shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you
must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with
her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!"""
345,7,111,"We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.
Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not
asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke
to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid
them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and
coming over to the bed, said cheerily: -  -"
345,7,112,"""Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good
child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes."" She had made
the effort with success."
345,7,113,"It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked
the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to
flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest
its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was
satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his
coat. Then he added: ""You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring
over the table. Friend John, help to me!"" So neither of us looked whilst
he bent over her."
345,7,114,"Van Helsing turning to me, said:"
345,7,115,"""He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
defibrinate it."""
345,7,116,"Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the
operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come
back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy
of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow
anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he
was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must
have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.
But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with
his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own
heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: ""Do not stir an instant.
It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her."" When all was over I
could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his
arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round -  - the
man seems to have eyes in the back of his head: -  -"
345,7,117,"""The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have
presently."" And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the
pillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band
which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old
diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,
and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I
could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's
ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to
me, saying: ""Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port
wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep
much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to
his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,
that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways
the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you
can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell
her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you
have done. Good - bye."""
345,7,118,"When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,
but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her
breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a
whisper: -  -"
345,7,119,"""What do you make of that mark on her throat?"""
345,7,120,"""What do you make of it?"""
345,7,121,"""I have not examined it yet,"" I answered, and then and there proceeded
to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two
punctures, not large, but not wholesome - looking. There was no sign of
disease, but the edges were white and worn - looking, as if by some
trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it
was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned
the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed
would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must
have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion."
345,7,122,"""Well?"" said Van Helsing."
345,7,123,"""Well,"" said I, ""I can make nothing of it."" The Professor stood up. ""I
must go back to Amsterdam to - night,"" he said. ""There are books and
things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you
must not let your sight pass from her."""
345,7,124,"""Shall I have a nurse?"" I asked."
345,7,125,"""We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that
she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all
the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as
possible. And then we may begin."""
345,7,126,"""May begin?"" I said. ""What on earth do you mean?"""
345,7,127,"""We shall see!"" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment
later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held
up: -  -"
345,7,128,"""Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you
shall not sleep easy hereafter!"""
345,7,129,_Dr. Seward's Diary -  - continued._
345,7,130,"_8 September._ -  - I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself
off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being
from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,
and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the
absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra
that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she
almost pooh - poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed
strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made
preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the
night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by
the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed
sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together
and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort
and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she
did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once: -  -"
345,7,131,"""You do not want to go to sleep?"""
345,7,132,"""No; I am afraid."""
345,7,133,"""Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for."""
345,7,134,"""Ah, not if you were like me -  - if sleep was to you a presage of horror!"""
345,7,135,"""A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?"""
345,7,136,"""I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that is what is so terrible. All
this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought."""
345,7,137,"""But, my dear girl, you may sleep to - night. I am here watching you, and
I can promise that nothing will happen."""
345,7,138,"""Ah, I can trust you!"" I seized the opportunity, and said: ""I promise
you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once."""
345,7,139,"""You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will
sleep!"" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank
back, asleep."
345,7,140,"All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on
in a deep, tranquil, life - giving, health - giving sleep. Her lips were
slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad
dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind."
345,7,141,"In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took
myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short
wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result
of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all
day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my
zoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the
past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst
I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to - night, as
it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the
night mail and would join me early in the morning."
345,7,142,*       *       *       *       *
345,7,143,"_9 September_. -  - I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to
Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my
brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral
exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands
with me she looked sharply in my face and said: -  -"
345,7,144,"""No sitting up to - night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well
again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who
will sit up with you."" I would not argue the point, but went and had my
supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I
made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than
excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next
her own, where a cozy fire was burning. ""Now,"" she said, ""you must stay
here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the
sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I
shall call out, and you can come to me at once."" I could not but
acquiesce, for I was ""dog - tired,"" and could not have sat up had I tried.
So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,
I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything."
345,7,145,_Lucy Westenra's Diary._
345,7,146,"_9 September._ -  - I feel so happy to - night. I have been so miserably weak,
that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after
a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,
very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose
it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner
eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love
rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know
where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears
must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of
last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.
And to - night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and
within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!
Good - night, Arthur."
345,7,147,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,7,148,"_10 September._ -  - I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and
started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn
in an asylum, at any rate."
345,7,149,"""And how is our patient?"""
345,7,150,"""Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,"" I answered."
345,7,151,"""Come, let us see,"" he said. And together we went into the room."
345,7,152,"The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van
Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat - like tread, over to the bed."
345,7,153,"As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I
heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a
deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and
his exclamation of horror, ""Gott in Himmel!"" needed no enforcement from
his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his
iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble."
345,7,154,"There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly
white and wan - looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums
seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a
corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp
in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit
stood to him, and he put it down again softly. ""Quick!"" he said. ""Bring
the brandy."" I flew to the dining - room, and returned with the decanter.
He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising
suspense said: -  -"
345,7,155,"""It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is
undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have
to call on you yourself this time, friend John."" As he spoke, he was
dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I
had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt - sleeve. There was no
possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,
without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time -  - it did
not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no
matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling -  - Van Helsing
held up a warning finger. ""Do not stir,"" he said, ""but I fear that with
growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much
danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection
of morphia."" He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his
intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge
subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride
that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid
cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to
feel his own life - blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves."
345,7,156,"The Professor watched me critically. ""That will do,"" he said. ""Already?""
I remonstrated. ""You took a great deal more from Art."" To which he
smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied: -  -"
345,7,157,"""He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for her
and for others; and the present will suffice."""
345,7,158,"When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied
digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his
leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By - and - by
he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for
myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half
whispered: -  -"
345,7,159,"""Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up
unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and
enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!"""
345,7,160,"When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said: -  -"
345,7,161,"""You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and
rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me."""
345,7,162,"I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I
had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I
felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how
she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to
show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,
sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little
punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their
edges -  - tiny though they were."
345,7,163,"Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and
strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing
had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict
injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his
voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office."
345,7,164,"Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything
had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother
came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but
said to me gratefully: -  -"
345,7,165,"""We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really
must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale
yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you
do!"" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,
for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted
drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned
imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my
lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows."
345,7,166,"Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:
""Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I
stay here to - night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and
I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave
reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think
even the most not - probable. Good - night."""
345,7,167,"In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of
them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and
when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit
up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the ""foreign
gentleman."" I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that
their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen
similar instances of woman's kindness. I got back here in time for a
late dinner; went my rounds -  - all well; and set this down whilst waiting
for sleep. It is coming."
345,7,168,*       *       *       *       *
345,7,169,"_11 September._ -  - This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van
Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had
arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it
with much impressment -  - assumed, of course -  - and showed a great bundle of
white flowers."
345,7,170,"""These are for you, Miss Lucy,"" he said."
345,7,171,"""For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!"""
345,7,172,"""Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines."" Here
Lucy made a wry face. ""Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or
in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall
point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing
so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,
that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but
you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and
hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the
lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters
of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought
for in the Floridas, and find him all too late."""
345,7,173,"Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling
them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half - laughter, and
half - disgust: -  -"
345,7,174,"""Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,
these flowers are only common garlic."""
345,7,175,"To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his
iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting: -  -"
345,7,176,"""No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;
and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of
others if not for your own."" Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might
well be, he went on more gently: ""Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear
me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so
common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the
wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so
inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;
and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait
for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall
help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,
where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass - houses all the year.
I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here."""
345,7,177,"We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor's
actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia
that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them
securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over
the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get
in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed
all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round
the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and
presently I said: -  -"
345,7,178,"""Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but
this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he
would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit."""
345,7,179,"""Perhaps I am!"" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which
Lucy was to wear round her neck."
345,7,180,"We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her
neck. The last words he said to her were: -  -"
345,7,181,"""Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do
not to - night open the window or the door."""
345,7,182,"""I promise,"" said Lucy, ""and thank you both a thousand times for all
your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such
friends?"""
345,7,183,"As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said: -  -"
345,7,184,"""To - night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want -  - two nights of travel,
much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
and a night to sit up, without to wink. To - morrow in the morning early
you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
more strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!"""
345,7,185,"He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights
before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must
have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but
I felt it all the more, like unshed tears."
345,8,0,_Lucy Westenra's Diary._
345,8,1,"_12 September._ -  - How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.
Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He
positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been
right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread
being alone to - night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not
mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I
have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,
or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has
for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no
dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings
nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to - night, hoping for sleep,
and lying like Ophelia in the play, with ""virgin crants and maiden
strewments."" I never liked garlic before, but to - night it is delightful!
There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good - night,
everybody."
345,8,2,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,8,3,"_13 September._ -  - Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,
up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The
Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now."
345,8,4,"Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at
eight o'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the
fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's
annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,
but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met
Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early
riser. She greeted us warmly and said: -  -"
345,8,5,"""You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still
asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I
should disturb her."" The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He
rubbed his hands together, and said: -  -"
345,8,6,"""Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,"" to
which she answered: -  -"
345,8,7,"""You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state this
morning is due in part to me."""
345,8,8,"""How you do mean, ma'am?"" asked the Professor."
345,8,9,"""Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into
her room. She was sleeping soundly -  - so soundly that even my coming did
not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those
horrible, strong - smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually
a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be
too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away
and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be
pleased with her, I am sure."""
345,8,10,"She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As
she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen
grey. He had been able to retain his self - command whilst the poor lady
was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;
he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into
her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and
forcibly, into the dining - room and closed the door."
345,8,11,"Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He
raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat
his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,
and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs
that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised
his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. ""God! God!
God!"" he said. ""What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that
we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the
pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor
mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such
thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we
must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are
beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!"" Suddenly he
jumped to his feet. ""Come,"" he said, ""come, we must see and act. Devils
or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him
all the same."" He went to the hall - door for his bag; and together we
went up to Lucy's room."
345,8,12,"Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.
This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same
awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and
infinite pity."
345,8,13,"""As I expected,"" he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which
meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then
began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another
operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the
necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a
warning hand. ""No!"" he said. ""To - day you must operate. I shall provide.
You are weakened already."" As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled
up his shirt - sleeve."
345,8,14,"Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to
the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I
watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested."
345,8,15,"Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must
not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him; that the
flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour
was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case
himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would
send me word when to come."
345,8,16,"After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and
seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal."
345,8,17,"What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life
amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain."
345,8,18,_Lucy Westenra's Diary._
345,8,19,"_17 September._ -  - Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong
again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some
long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and
feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim
half - remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness
in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress
more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to
life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,
however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems
to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my
wits -  - the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed
so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and
commanded me to do I know not what -  - have all ceased. I go to bed now
without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown
quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from
Haarlem. To - night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a
day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left
alone. Thank God for mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all our
friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for
last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found
him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,
although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against
the window - panes."

345,8,21,THE ESCAPED WOLF.
345,8,22,PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.
345,8,23,_Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens._
345,8,24,"After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using
the words ""Pall Mall Gazette"" as a sort of talisman, I managed to find
the keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf
department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in
the enclosure behind the elephant - house, and was just sitting down to
his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,
elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their
hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty
comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called ""business""
until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the
table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said: -  -"
345,8,25,"""Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You'll excoose me
refoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the
wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore
I begins to arsk them questions."""
345,8,26,"""How do you mean, ask them questions?"" I queried, wishful to get him
into a talkative humour."
345,8,27,"""'Ittin' of them over the 'ead with a pole is one way; scratchin' of
their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show - orf
to their gals. I don't so much mind the fust -  - the 'ittin' with a pole
afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they've 'ad their
sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the
ear - scratchin'. Mind you,"" he added philosophically, ""there's a deal of
the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here's you a - comin' and
arskin' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy - like that
only for your bloomin' 'arf - quid I'd 'a' seen you blowed fust 'fore I'd
answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic - like if I'd like you to
arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence
did I tell yer to go to 'ell?"""
345,8,28,"""You did."""
345,8,29,"""An' when you said you'd report me for usin' of obscene language that
was 'ittin' me over the 'ead; but the 'arf - quid made that all right. I
weren't a - goin' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my 'owl
as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor' love yer 'art, now
that the old 'ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea - cake in me, an' rinsed
me out with her bloomin' old teapot, and I've lit hup, you may scratch
my ears for all you're worth, and won't git even a growl out of me.
Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a - comin' at, that 'ere
escaped wolf."""
345,8,30,"""Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it
happened; and when I know the facts I'll get you to say what you
consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
end."""
345,8,31,"""All right, guv'nor. This 'ere is about the 'ole story. That 'ere wolf
what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
Norway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a
nice well - behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I'm more
surprised at 'im for wantin' to get out nor any other animile in the
place. But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women."""
345,8,32,"""Don't you mind him, sir!"" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. ""'E's
got mindin' the animiles so long that blest if he ain't like a old wolf
'isself! But there ain't no 'arm in 'im."""
345,8,33,"""Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yesterday when I first
hear my disturbance. I was makin' up a litter in the monkey - house for a
young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kem
away straight. There was Bersicker a - tearin' like a mad thing at the
bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn't much people about that
day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ook
nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it. He
had a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,
for it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at. He 'ad white
kid gloves on 'is 'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:
'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.'"
345,8,34,"""'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give
'isself. He didn't git angry, as I 'oped he would, but he smiled a kind
of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. 'Oh no, they
wouldn't like me,' 'e says."
345,8,35,"""'Ow yes, they would,' says I, a - imitatin' of him. 'They always likes a
bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea - time, which you 'as a
bagful.'"
345,8,36,"""Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a - talkin' they
lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears
same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't put
in his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too!"
345,8,37,"""'Tyke care,' says I. 'Bersicker is quick.'"
345,8,38,"""'Never mind,' he says. 'I'm used to 'em!'"
345,8,39,"""'Are you in the business yourself?' I says, tyking off my 'at, for a
man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers."
345,8,40,"""'No' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but I 'ave made pets of
several.' And with that he lifts his 'at as perlite as a lord, and walks
away. Old Bersicker kep' a - lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight,
and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'ole
hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves
here all began a - 'owling. There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at.
There warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a - callin' a
dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice
I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owling
stopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round afore
turnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker's
cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And
that's all I know for certing."""
345,8,41,"""Did any one else see anything?"""
345,8,42,"""One of our gard'ners was a - comin' 'ome about that time from a 'armony,
when he sees a big grey dog comin' out through the garding 'edges. At
least, so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did 'e
never said a word about it to his missis when 'e got 'ome, and it was
only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all
night - a - huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein'
anything. My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead."""
345,8,43,"""Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the
wolf?"""
345,8,44,"""Well, sir,"" he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, ""I think I can;
but I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory."""
345,8,45,"""Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from
experience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?"""
345,8,46,"""Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that 'ere
wolf escaped -  - simply because he wanted to get out."""
345,8,47,"From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I
could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn't cope in badinage
with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,
so I said: -  -"
345,8,48,"""Now, Mr. Bilder, we'll consider that first half - sovereign worked off,
and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told me
what you think will happen."""
345,8,49,"""Right y'are, sir,"" he said briskly. ""Ye'll excoose me, I know, for
a - chaffin' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much
as telling me to go on."""
345,8,50,"""Well, I never!"" said the old lady."
345,8,51,"""My opinion is this: that 'ere wolf is a - 'idin' of, somewheres. The
gard'ner wot didn't remember said he was a - gallopin' northward faster
than a horse could go; but I don't believe him, for, yer see, sir,
wolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein' built that
way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets
in packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they is
they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,
Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so
clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in
'im. This one ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' for
hisself, and more like he's somewhere round the Park a - 'idin' an'
a - shiverin' of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin' where he is to get
his breakfast from; or maybe he's got down some area and is in a
coal - cellar. My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees his
green eyes a - shining at her out of the dark! If he can't get food he's
bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher's
shop in time. If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes a - walkin' orf with
a soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator -  - well, then I
shouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That's
all."""
345,8,52,"I was handing him the half - sovereign, when something came bobbing up
against the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural length
with surprise."
345,8,53,"""God bless me!"" he said. ""If there ain't old Bersicker come back by
'isself!"""
345,8,54,"He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it
seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so
well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a
personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea."
345,8,55,"After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor
his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal
itself was as peaceful and well - behaved as that father of all
picture - wolves -  - Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving her
confidence in masquerade."
345,8,56,"The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The
wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the
children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of
penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine
prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender
solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said: -  -"
345,8,57,"""There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;
didn't I say it all along? Here's his head all cut and full of broken
glass. 'E's been a - gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other. It's a
shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.
This 'ere's what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker."""
345,8,58,"He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that
satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the
fatted calf, and went off to report."
345,8,59,"I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
to - day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo."
345,8,60,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,8,61,"_17 September._ -  - I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my
books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,
had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in
rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was
thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord
into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's
pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner - knife in his hand, and,
as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was
too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my
balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.
Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was
sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a
little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not
intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the
attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment
positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking
up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was
easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite
placidly, simply repeating over and over again: ""The blood is the life!
The blood is the life!"""
345,8,62,"I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of
late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy's
illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over - excited and
weary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned
me, so I need not forego my sleep; to - night I could not well do without
it."
345,8,63,"_Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._"
345,8,64,"(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by
twenty - two hours.)"
345,8,65,"""_17 September._ -  - Do not fail to be at Hillingham to - night. If not
watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as
placed; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as
possible after arrival."""
345,8,66,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,8,67,"_18 September._ -  - Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van
Helsing's telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know
by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is
possible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surely
there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident
should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with
me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph."
345,8,68,_Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra._
345,8,69,"_17 September. Night._ -  - I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no
one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact
record of what took place to - night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and
have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the
doing."
345,8,70,"I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.
Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep."
345,8,71,"I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that
sleep - walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I
know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in
the next room -  - as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be -  - so that I might have
called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me
the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep
would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be
alone, I opened my door and called out: ""Is there anybody there?"" There
was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.
Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but
more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could
see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its
wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined
not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;
seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She
said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont: -  -"
345,8,72,"""I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all
right."""
345,8,73,"I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in
and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did
not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while
and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in
hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was
startled and a little frightened, and cried out: ""What is that?"" I tried
to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could
hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was
the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a
crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the
aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey
wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting
posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst
other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing
insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a
second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange
and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over -  - as if struck
with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a
moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my
eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole
myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken
window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that
travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to
stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body,
which seemed to grow cold already -  - for her dear heart had ceased to
beat -  - weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while."
345,8,74,"The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered
consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the
dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,
seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and
stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the
nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear
their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they
came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay
over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the
broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my
dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I
had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them
to go to the dining - room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew
open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went
in a body to the dining - room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear
mother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing
had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would
have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that
the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went
to the dining - room to look for them."
345,8,75,"My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless
on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table
half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,
and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the
sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for
her -  - oh! did use -  - was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back
in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for
the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I
dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the
broken window."
345,8,76,"The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from
the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God
shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,
where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother
gone! It is time that I go too. Good - bye, dear Arthur, if I should not
survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!"
345,9,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
345,9,1,"_18 September._ -  - I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.
Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently
and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her
mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,
finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed
the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an
hour -  - for it was now ten o'clock -  - and so rang and knocked again, but
more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only
the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this
desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing
tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too
late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of
danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;
and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry
anywhere."
345,9,2,"I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and
locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the
rapid pit - pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at the
gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.
When he saw me, he gasped out: -  -"
345,9,3,"""Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you
not get my telegram?"""
345,9,4,"I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his
telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,
and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and
raised his hat as he said solemnly: -  -"
345,9,5,"""Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!"" With his usual
recuperative energy, he went on: ""Come. If there be no way open to get
in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now."""
345,9,6,"We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen
window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and
handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I
attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then
with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and
opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There
was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at
hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining - room,
dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four
servant - women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,
for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the
room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at
each other, and as we moved away he said: ""We can attend to them later.""
Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the
door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white
faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the
room."
345,9,7,"How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her
mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white
sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the
broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror
fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more
drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her
mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds
which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.
Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching
poor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who
listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me: -  -"
345,9,8,"""It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!"""
345,9,9,"I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste
it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found
on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I
fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,
but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another
occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her
hands. He said to me: -  -"
345,9,10,"""I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.
Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them
get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as
that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything
more."""
345,9,11,"I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently
affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her
sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to
them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with
them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life
was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice
Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad
as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and
boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We
got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst
we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One
of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then
she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come
with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he
must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,
and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him."
345,9,12,"I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly
earnest. I knew -  - as he knew -  - that it was a stand - up fight with death,
and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not
understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear: -  -"
345,9,13,"""If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade
away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon."" He went
on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour."
345,9,14,"Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to
be of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the
stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's
face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in
a hot sheet to dry her he said to me: -  -"
345,9,15,"""The first gain is ours! Check to the King!"""
345,9,16,"We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid
her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed
that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was
still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had
ever seen her."
345,9,17,"Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her
and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me
out of the room."
345,9,18,"""We must consult as to what is to be done,"" he said as we descended the
stairs. In the hall he opened the dining - room door, and we passed in, he
closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but
the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of
death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly
observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light
enough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved
by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about
something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke: -  -"
345,9,19,"""What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have
another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life
won't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am
exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have
courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his
veins for her?"""
345,9,20,"""What's the matter with me, anyhow?"""
345,9,21,"The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van
Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: ""Quincey Morris!"" and
rushed towards him with outstretched hands."
345,9,22,"""What brought you here?"" I cried as our hands met."
345,9,23,"""I guess Art is the cause."""
345,9,24,He handed me a telegram: -  -
345,9,25,"""Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.
Do not delay. -  - HOLMWOOD."""
345,9,26,"""I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell
me what to do."""
345,9,27,"Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
the eyes as he said: -  -"
345,9,28,"""A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in
trouble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against
us for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them."""
345,9,29,"Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart
to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it
told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her
veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other
occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see
and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van
Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with
good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched
whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids
to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down
after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good
breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where
Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or
two of note - paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was
thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look
of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.
He handed me the paper saying only: ""It dropped from Lucy's breast when
we carried her to the bath."""
345,9,30,"When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause
asked him: ""In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,
mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?"" I was so bewildered that I
did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the
paper, saying: -  -"
345,9,31,"""Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know
and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what
is it that you came to me to say?"" This brought me back to fact, and I
was all myself again."
345,9,32,"""I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act
properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have
to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we
had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you
know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra
had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us
fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the
registrar and go on to the undertaker."""
345,9,33,"""Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be
sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that
love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old
man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the
more for it! Now go."""
345,9,34,"In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him
that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now
going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him
where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said: -  -"
345,9,35,"""When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to
ourselves?"" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about
the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in
the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements."
345,9,36,"When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him
as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still
sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her
side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he
expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.
So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast - room, where
the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or
rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said
to me: -  -"
345,9,37,"""Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no
right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl
and wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't
help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrong
with her? The Dutchman -  - and a fine old fellow he is; I can see
that -  - said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have
_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.
Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man
must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is
no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that
so?"""
345,9,38,"""That's so,"" I said, and he went on: -  -"
345,9,39,"""I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did
to - day. Is not that so?"""
345,9,40,"""That's so."""
345,9,41,"""And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his
own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick
since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass
all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at
her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there
wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a
bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without
betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?"" As he spoke
the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense
regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible
mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very
heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him -  - and there was a
royal lot of it, too -  - to keep him from breaking down. I paused before
answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the
Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed
so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered
in the same phrase: ""That's so."""
345,9,42,"""And how long has this been going on?"""
345,9,43,"""About ten days."""
345,9,44,"""Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature
that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it."" Then,
coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half - whisper: ""What took it
out?"""
345,9,45,"I shook my head. ""That,"" I said, ""is the crux. Van Helsing is simply
frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end. I can't even hazard a guess.
There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out
all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall
not occur again. Here we stay until all be well -  - or ill."" Quincey held
out his hand. ""Count me in,"" he said. ""You and the Dutchman will tell me
what to do, and I'll do it."""
345,9,46,"When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel
in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing
had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had
come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van
Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,
and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her
poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that
meant -  - that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we tried
what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but
she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for
a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with
her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell
into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she
took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped
over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on
with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her
hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering
the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as
if in thought, but he said nothing."
345,9,47,*       *       *       *       *
345,9,48,"_19 September._ -  - All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid
to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and
I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment
unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew
that all night long he patrolled round and round the house."
345,9,49,"When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's
strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she
slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between
sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more
haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale
gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and
sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently
changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying
one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
Quincey went off to meet him at the station."
345,9,50,"When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full
and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more
colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking
with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,
the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had
grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible
were shortened. Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a
stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she
had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as
cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything."
345,9,51,"It was now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with
her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering
this on Lucy's phonograph. Until six o'clock they are to try to rest. I
fear that to - morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too
great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all."

345,9,55,"""My dearest Lucy, -  -"
345,9,56,"""It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You
will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my
budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived
at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had
an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there
were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After
dinner Mr. Hawkins said: -  -"
345,9,57,"""'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every
blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with
love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here
with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in
my will I have left you everything.' I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and
the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one."
345,9,58,"""So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my
bedroom and the drawing - room I can see the great elms of the cathedral
close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow
stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and
cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of
rooks -  - and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and
housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that
Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the
clients."
345,9,59,"""How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a
day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my
shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to
put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the
long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden
way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual
placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the
days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now
I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,
and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,
and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,
dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests
you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his
'respectful duty,' but I do not think that is good enough from the
junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you
love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses
of the verb, I send you simply his 'love' instead. Good - bye, my dearest
Lucy, and all blessings on you."

345,9,64,"""My dear Sir, -  -"
345,9,65,"""In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of
everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there
is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a
dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended
with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men
made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours -  - the house to
which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at
our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was
myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and
saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of
Renfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called
him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a
decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to ""shut up for a
foul - mouthed beggar,"" whereon our man accused him of robbing him and
wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to
swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his
mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless
yer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse. I
pity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild
beast like that.' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him
where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats
and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could
make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a
well - behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had
ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most
genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he
blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe
that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to
say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an
hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the
window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the
attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent
on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which
had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden
boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the
face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the
patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to
knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the
moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other
fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt - end of his
heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but
seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and
fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others
were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we
began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait - waistcoat
on him, he began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me!
they shan't murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' and
all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable
difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded
room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set
it all right; and he is going on well."
345,9,66,"""The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their
threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for
the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it
had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and
raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of
him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their
labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their
drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and
with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of
meeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent. I took their
names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as

345,9,74,"""My dearest Lucy, -  -"
345,9,75,"""Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.
Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him
that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either
father or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.
Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,
deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,
and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a
fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the
dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the
amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He
begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_
helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave
shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard
that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his -  - a nature which
enabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master
in a few years -  - should be so injured that the very essence of its
strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in
the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,
for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan
tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming
up to London, as we must do the day after to - morrow; for poor Mr.
Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his
father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief

345,9,78,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,9,79,"_20 September._ -  - Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry
to - night. I am too miserable, too low - spirited, too sick of the world
and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard
this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has
been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late -  - Lucy's mother
and Arthur's father, and now.... Let me get on with my work."
345,9,80,"I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to
go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him
that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not
all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed
to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. ""Come, my child,"" he said;
""come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much
mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You
must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
Come to the drawing - room, where there is a big fire, and there are two
sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will
be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we
sleep."" Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's
face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay
quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it
should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,
as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the
window - sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk
handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of
the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and
her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her
teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they
had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the
canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,
and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort
of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,
and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,
and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled
round -  - doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim -  - and every now
and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,
I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic
flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat
watching her."
345,9,81,"Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.
She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with
her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto
so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she
became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was
certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the
stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she
waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any
mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many
spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times."
345,9,82,"At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen
into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy's face
I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a
sharp whisper: ""Draw up the blind; I want light!"" Then he bent down,
and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He
removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As
he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, ""Mein
Gott!"" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,
and as I noticed some queer chill came over me."
345,9,83,The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.
345,9,84,"For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face
at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly: -  -"
345,9,85,"""She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark
me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and
let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him."""
345,9,86,"I went to the dining - room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but
when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters
he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy
was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van
Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his
hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,
perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders
shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. ""Come,"" I
said, ""my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best
and easiest for her."""
345,9,87,"When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, with
his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy's
hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we
came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
softly: -  -"
345,9,88,"""Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!"" He was stooping to
kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. ""No,"" he whispered, ""not
yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more."""
345,9,89,"So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then
gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her
breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's."
345,9,90,"And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in
the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale
gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a
sort of sleep - waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which
were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,
such as I had never heard from her lips: -  -"
345,9,91,"""Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!"" Arthur bent
eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,
had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by
the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which
I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost
across the room."
345,9,92,"""Not for your life!"" he said; ""not for your living soul and hers!"" And
he stood between them like a lion at bay."
345,9,93,"Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do
or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised
the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting."
345,9,94,"I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as
of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed
together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily."
345,9,95,"Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown
one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. ""My true friend,"" she said, in a
faint voice, but with untellable pathos, ""My true friend, and his! Oh,
guard him, and give me peace!"""
345,9,96,"""I swear it!"" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his
hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said
to him: ""Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the
forehead, and only once."""
345,9,97,Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.
345,9,98,"Lucy's eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took
Arthur's arm, and drew him away."
345,9,99,"And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it
ceased."
345,9,100,"""It is all over,"" said Van Helsing. ""She is dead!"""
345,9,101,"I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing - room, where he
sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that
nearly broke me down to see."
345,9,102,"I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and
his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.
Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had
recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their
deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working
of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as
might be."
345,9,103,"""We thought her dying whilst she slept,
And sleeping when she died."""
345,9,104,"I stood beside Van Helsing, and said: -  -"
345,9,105,"""Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!"""
345,9,106,"He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity: -  -"
345,9,107,"""Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!"""
345,9,108,"When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered: -  -"
345,9,109,"""We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see."""
345,10,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY -  - _continued_.
345,10,1,"The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and
her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly
formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
afflicted -  - or blessed -  - with something of his own obsequious suavity.
Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to
me, in a confidential, brother - professional way, when she had come out
from the death - chamber: -  -"
345,10,2,"""She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege to
attend on her. It's not too much to say that she will do credit to our
establishment!"""
345,10,3,"I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from
the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives
at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his
father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been
bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon
ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy's
papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a
foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and
so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me: -  -"
345,10,4,"""I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But
this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the
coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more -  - such
as this."""
345,10,5,"As he spoke he took from his pocket - book the memorandum which had been
in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep."
345,10,6,"""When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.
Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to - night. For me, I watch
here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself
search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into
the hands of strangers."""
345,10,7,"I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found
the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to
him. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions
regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the
letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,
saying: -  -"
345,10,8,"""Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to
you."""
345,10,9,"""Have you got what you looked for?"" I asked, to which he replied: -  -"
345,10,10,"""I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I
have, all that there was -  - only some letters and a few memoranda, and a
diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say
nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to - morrow evening, and, with
his sanction, I shall use some."""
345,10,11,"When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me: -  -"
345,10,12,"""And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you
and I, and rest to recuperate. To - morrow we shall have much to do, but
for the to - night there is no need of us. Alas!"""
345,10,13,"Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had
certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small
_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the
winding - sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and
turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall
wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy's
loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,
instead of leaving traces of ""decay's effacing fingers,"" had but
restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes
that I was looking at a corpse."
345,10,14,"The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and
there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: ""Remain till I
return,"" and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic
from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he
took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and
placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we
came away."
345,10,15,"I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the
door, he entered, and at once began to speak: -  -"
345,10,16,"""To - morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post - mortem
knives."""
345,10,17,"""Must we make an autopsy?"" I asked."
345,10,18,"""Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you
now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out
her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with
no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make
the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that
you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall
operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to - night, but for
Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father's funeral to - morrow,
and he will want to see her -  - to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined
ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall
unscrew the coffin - lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace
all, so that none know, save we alone."""
345,10,19,"""But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body
without need? And if there is no necessity for a post - mortem and nothing
to gain by it -  - no good to her, to us, to science, to human
knowledge -  - why do it? Without such it is monstrous."""
345,10,20,"For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
tenderness: -  -"
345,10,21,"""Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more
because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden
that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you
shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant
things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err -  - I am but
man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you
send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay
horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love -  - though she was
dying -  - and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw
how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so
weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not
hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!"
345,10,22,"""Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many
years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so
strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend
John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is
not perhaps well. And if I work -  - as work I shall, no matter trust or no
trust -  - without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,
oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!"" He paused a
moment and went on solemnly: ""Friend John, there are strange and
terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
a good end. Will you not have faith in me?"""
345,10,23,"I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,
and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without
moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage -  - she had
her back towards me, so did not see me -  - and go into the room where Lucy
lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl
putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay
might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest...."
345,10,24,*       *       *       *       *
345,10,25,"I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van
Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and
said: -  -"
345,10,26,"""You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it."""
345,10,27,"""Why not?"" I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly
impressed me."
345,10,28,"""Because,"" he said sternly, ""it is too late -  - or too early. See!"" Here he
held up the little golden crucifix. ""This was stolen in the night."""
345,10,29,"""How, stolen,"" I asked in wonder, ""since you have it now?"""
345,10,30,"""Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely
come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus
unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait."""
345,10,31,"He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a
new puzzle to grapple with."
345,10,32,"The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.
Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial
and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for
some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain
entailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of direct
issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had
told us so much he went on: -  -"
345,10,33,"""Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and
pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either
penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial
alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into
collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out
her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were
right in principle, and ninety - nine times out of a hundred we should
have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.
Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of
disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her
wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come
into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her
mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no
will -  - and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case -  - have been
treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,
though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the
inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just
rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure
you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced."""
345,10,34,"He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part -  - in which
he was officially interested -  - of so great a tragedy, was an
object - lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding."
345,10,35,"He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and
see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to
us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile
criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so
a little before that time we visited the death - chamber. It was so in
very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,
true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and
there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at
once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be
less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_
quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them
the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings
as we could avoid were saved."
345,10,36,"Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart
manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his
much - tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly
attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a
bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he
was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some
constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to
bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I
felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and
led me in, saying huskily: -  -"
345,10,37,"""You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was
no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to
thank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet...."""
345,10,38,"Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and
laid his head on my breast, crying: -  -"
345,10,39,"""Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me
all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for."""
345,10,40,"I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much
expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the
shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's
heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said
softly to him: -  -"
345,10,41,"""Come and look at her."""
345,10,42,"Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.
God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her
loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he
fell a - trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At
last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper: -  -"
345,10,43,"""Jack, is she really dead?"""
345,10,44,"I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest -  - for I felt
that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than
I could help -  - that it often happened that after death faces became
softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was
especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after
kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and
long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good - bye, as the
coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his
and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,
fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came."
345,10,45,"I left him in the drawing - room, and told Van Helsing that he had said
good - bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men
to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he
came out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he
replied: -  -"
345,10,46,"""I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!"""
345,10,47,"We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make
the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner - time; but
when we had lit our cigars he said -  -"
345,10,48,"""Lord -  -  -  - ""; but Arthur interrupted him: -  -"
345,10,49,"""No, no, not that, for God's sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:
I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so
recent."""
345,10,50,The Professor answered very sweetly: -  -
345,10,51,"""I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you
'Mr.,' and I have grown to love you -  - yes, my dear boy, to love you -  - as
Arthur."""
345,10,52,"Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly."
345,10,53,"""Call me what you will,"" he said. ""I hope I may always have the title of
a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for
your goodness to my poor dear."" He paused a moment, and went on: ""I know
that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was
rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so -  - you remember"" -  - the
Professor nodded -  - ""you must forgive me."""
345,10,54,He answered with a grave kindness: -  -
345,10,55,"""I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such
violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not -  - that you
cannot -  - trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be
more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot -  - and may
not -  - and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust
shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as
though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from
first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her
dear sake to whom I swore to protect."""
345,10,56,"""And, indeed, indeed, sir,"" said Arthur warmly, ""I shall in all ways
trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are
Jack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like."""
345,10,57,"The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to
speak, and finally said: -  -"
345,10,58,"""May I ask you something now?"""
345,10,59,"""Certainly."""
345,10,60,"""You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?"""
345,10,61,"""No, poor dear; I never thought of it."""
345,10,62,"""And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I
want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers and
letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,
be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them
before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch
them -  - no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep
them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them
safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back
to you. It's a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for
Lucy's sake?"""
345,10,63,"Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self: -  -"
345,10,64,"""Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I
am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you
with questions till the time comes."""
345,10,65,The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly: -  -
345,10,66,"""And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be
all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too -  - you most of
all, my dear boy -  - will have to pass through the bitter water before we
reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our
duty, and all will be well!"""
345,10,67,"I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night. Van Helsing did not go to
bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was
never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with
the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,
a heavy, overpowering smell into the night."
345,10,68,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,10,69,_22 September._ -  - In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.
345,10,70,"It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much
between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and
no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a
partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and
Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me
about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand -  - see what
unexpected prosperity does for us -  - so it may be as well to freshen it up
again with an exercise anyhow...."
345,10,71,"The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves
and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his
London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the
President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in
hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us...."
345,10,72,"We came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner.
Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so
we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
sad - looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think
of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.
Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days
before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can't go on
for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the
pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he
was my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us -  - and we didn't
care if they did -  - so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful
girl, in a big cart - wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's,
when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said
under his breath: ""My God!"" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I
fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him
quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him."
345,10,73,"He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and
half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and
black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty
girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,
and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was
hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all
the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.
Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I
feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked
Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that
I knew as much about it as he did: ""Do you see who it is?"""
345,10,74,"""No, dear,"" I said; ""I don't know him; who is it?"" His answer seemed to
shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was
to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking: -  -"
345,10,75,"""It is the man himself!"""
345,10,76,"The poor dear was evidently terrified at something -  - very greatly
terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to
support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of
the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove
off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage
moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a
hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself: -  -"
345,10,77,"""I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be
so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!"" He was
distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the
subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him
away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little
further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was
a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.
After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and he
went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it
was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty
minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully: -  -"
345,10,78,"""Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.
Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere."" He had evidently forgotten
all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that
this episode had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing into
forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must
not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow
learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I
must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,
I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake."

345,10,80,"_Later._ -  - A sad home - coming in every way -  - the house empty of the dear
soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight
relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he
may be: -  -"
345,10,81,"""You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and
that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to - day."""
345,10,82,"Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor
Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have
lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our
troubles."
345,10,83,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,10,84,"_22 September._ -  - It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has
taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe
in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as any
of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America
can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world
indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his
journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to - night, but says he returns
to - morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can
only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says
he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old
fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his
iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting
some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were
standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in
the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins; I
could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was
saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married
and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of
the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went
away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The
moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of
hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted
that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very
terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down
the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,
till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman
does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the
circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in
manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew
grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.
His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and
forceful and mysterious. He said: -  -"
345,10,85,"""Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,
though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But
no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come
just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your
door and say, 'May I come in?' is not the true laughter. No! he is a
king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no
time of suitability. He say, 'I am here.' Behold, in example I grieve my
heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though
I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other
sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very
grave -  - laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her
coffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to my heart, till it send back the blood
from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy -  - that dear boy, so of
the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his
hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet
when he say things that touch my husband - heart to the quick, and make my
father - heart yearn to him as to no other man -  - not even to you, friend
John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son -  - yet even
at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,
'Here I am! here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some of
the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is
a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and
troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the
tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and
tears that burn as they fall -  - all dance together to the music that he
make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that
he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn
tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,
like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain
become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the
sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with
our labour, what it may be."""
345,10,86,"I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I
did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he
answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different
tone: -  -"
345,10,87,"""Oh, it was the grim irony of it all -  - this so lovely lady garlanded with
flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she
were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely
churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother
who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going 'Toll!
toll! toll!' so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all
for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?"""
345,10,88,"""Well, for the life of me, Professor,"" I said, ""I can't see anything to
laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle
than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking."""
345,10,89,"""Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had
made her truly his bride?"""
345,10,90,"""Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him."""
345,10,91,"""Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then
what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,
and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, though
no wits, all gone -  - even I, who am faithful husband to this now - no - wife,
am bigamist."""
345,10,92,"""I don't see where the joke comes in there either!"" I said; and I did
not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid
his hand on my arm, and said: -  -"
345,10,93,"""Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others
when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.
If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;
if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him -  - for
he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time -  - maybe you would
perhaps pity me the most of all."""
345,10,94,"I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why."
345,10,95,"""Because I know!"""
345,10,96,"And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will
sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her
kin, a lordly death - house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming
London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,
and where wild flowers grow of their own accord."
345,10,97,"So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin
another. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with
different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my
life - work, I say sadly and without hope,"

345,10,100,A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.
345,10,101,"The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a
series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
was known to the writers of headlines as ""The Kensington Horror,"" or
""The Stabbing Woman,"" or ""The Woman in Black."" During the past two or
three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from
home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all
these cases the children were too young to give any properly
intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
is that they had been with a ""bloofer lady."" It has always been late in
the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is
generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed
gave as his reason for being away that a ""bloofer lady"" had asked him to
come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as
occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the
little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A
correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to
be the ""bloofer lady"" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists
might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the
reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general
principles of human nature that the ""bloofer lady"" should be the popular
rôle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naïvely says
that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of
these grubby - faced little children pretend -  - and even imagine
themselves -  - to be."
345,10,102,"There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of
the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be
made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance
individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has
a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been
instructed to keep a sharp look - out for straying children, especially
when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog
which may be about."

345,10,108,"We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last
night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the
Shooter's Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less
frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the
throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and
looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common
story to tell of being lured away by the ""bloofer lady."""

345,11,1,"_23 September_. -  - Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that
he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible
things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the
responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,
and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his
advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon
him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch
at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,
and lock myself up in my room and read it...."
345,11,2,"_24 September_. -  - I hadn't the heart to write last night; that terrible
record of Jonathan's upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,
whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth
in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those
terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall
never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man
we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I
suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some
train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our
wedding - day he said: ""Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to
the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane."" There seems to be
through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was
coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his
teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must
not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter
this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other
eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,
poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let
him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets
over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him
questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him."

love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It is
for others' good that I ask -  - to redress great wrong, and to lift much

345,11,12,MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL.
345,11,13,"_25 September._ -  - I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that
it will throw some light upon Jonathan's sad experience; and as he
attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about
her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her
sleep - walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real
truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my
imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of
course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that
awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten
in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him
of her sleep - walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about
it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may
understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.
Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even
a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van
Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of
late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present."
345,11,14,"I suppose a cry does us all good at times -  - clears the air as other rain
does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day
and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do
hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
occur to upset him. It is two o'clock, and the doctor will be here soon
now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal unless he asks me. I am
so glad I have type - written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks
about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning."

345,11,16,"_Later._ -  - He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it
all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all
possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan's journal
first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear
Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may
not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even
a consolation and a help to him -  - terrible though it be and awful in its
consequences -  - to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did
not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt
which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter
which -  - waking or dreaming -  - may prove the truth, he will be more
satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a
good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's friend and Dr.
Seward's, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after
Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a
noble nature. When he comes to - morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;
and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good
end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan's
friend on ""The Exeter News"" told him that memory was everything in such
work -  - that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare
interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_."
345,11,17,"It was half - past two o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _à
deux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and
announced ""Dr. Van Helsing."""
345,11,18,"I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,
strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and
a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise
of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the
head is noble, well - sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,
clean - shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile
mouth, a good - sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive
nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the
mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost
straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;
such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,
but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set
widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods. He
said to me: -  -"
345,11,19,"""Mrs. Harker, is it not?"" I bowed assent."
345,11,20,"""That was Miss Mina Murray?"" Again I assented."
345,11,21,"""It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear
child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come."""
345,11,22,"""Sir,"" I said, ""you could have no better claim on me than that you were
a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra."" And I held out my hand. He took
it and said tenderly: -  -"
345,11,23,"""Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
good, but I had yet to learn -  -  -  - "" He finished his speech with a courtly
bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at
once began: -  -"
345,11,24,"""I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin
to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were
with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary -  - you need not look
surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in
imitation of you -  - and in that diary she traces by inference certain
things to a sleep - walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In
great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much
kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember."""
345,11,25,"""I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it."""
345,11,26,"""Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always
so with young ladies."""
345,11,27,"""No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you
if you like."""
345,11,28,"""Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour."" I
could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit -  - I suppose it is
some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
mouths -  - so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful
bow, and said: -  -"
345,11,29,"""May I read it?"""
345,11,30,"""If you wish,"" I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for
an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed."
345,11,31,"""Oh, you so clever woman!"" he said. ""I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a
man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?
Alas! I know not the shorthand."" By this time my little joke was over,
and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my
workbasket and handed it to him."
345,11,32,"""Forgive me,"" I said: ""I could not help it; but I had been thinking that
it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not
have time to wait -  - not on my account, but because I know your time must
be precious -  - I have written it out on the typewriter for you."""
345,11,33,"He took it and his eyes glistened. ""You are so good,"" he said. ""And may
I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read."""
345,11,34,"""By all means,"" I said, ""read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you
can ask me questions whilst we eat."" He bowed and settled himself in a
chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,
whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be
disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down
the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and
took me by both hands."
345,11,35,"""Oh, Madam Mina,"" he said, ""how can I say what I owe to you? This paper
is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so
much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that
you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so
clever woman. Madam"" -  - he said this very solemnly -  - ""if ever Abraham Van
Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.
It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a
friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you
and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;
you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and
your husband will be blessed in you."""
345,11,36,"""But, doctor, you praise me too much, and -  - and you do not know me."""
345,11,37,"""Not know you -  - I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to
him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you
have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every
line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your
marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell
all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
angels' eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your
husband -  - tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and
is he strong and hearty?"" I saw here an opening to ask him about
Jonathan, so I said: -  -"
345,11,38,"""He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins's
death."" He interrupted: -  -"
345,11,39,"""Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters."" I went
on: -  -"
345,11,40,"""I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he
had a sort of shock."""
345,11,41,"""A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of
a shock was it?"""
345,11,42,"""He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
which led to his brain fever."" And here the whole thing seemed to
overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he
experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I
was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands
and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my
hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness: -  -"
345,11,43,"""My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not
had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by
my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such
nobility that I feel more than ever -  - and it has grown with my advancing
years -  - the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here
full of respect for you, and you have given me hope -  - hope, not in what I
am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life
happy -  - good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for
the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some
use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my
study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him
that I can -  - all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy
one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over - anxious.
Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not
where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat
and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not
speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to - night, for I
want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I
will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of
husband Jonathan's trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat
now; afterwards you shall tell me all."""
345,11,44,"After lunch, when we went back to the drawing - room, he said to me: -  -"
345,11,45,"""And now tell me all about him."" When it came to speaking to this great
learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and
Jonathan a madman -  - that journal is all so strange -  - and I hesitated to go
on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I
trusted him, so I said: -  -"
345,11,46,"""Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not
laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of
fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I
have even half believed some very strange things."" He reassured me by
his manner as well as his words when he said: -  -"
345,11,47,"""Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which
I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little
of any one's belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep
an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close
it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that
make one doubt if they be mad or sane."""
345,11,48,"""Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my
mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,
but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and
Jonathan's. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
me what you think."""
345,11,49,"""I promise,"" he said as I gave him the papers; ""I shall in the morning,
so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may."""
345,11,50,"""Jonathan will be here at half - past eleven, and you must come to lunch
with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which
will leave you at Paddington before eight."" He was surprised at my
knowledge of the trains off - hand, but he does not know that I have made
up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in
case he is in a hurry."
345,11,51,"So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here
thinking -  - thinking I don't know what."

345,11,66,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._
345,11,67,"_26 September._ -  - I thought never to write in this diary again, but the
time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and
when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing's visit, and of her having
given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been
about me. She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down was
true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the
reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in
the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even
of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing
is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what
Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I
shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over...."
345,11,68,"He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he
was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my
face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny: -  -"
345,11,69,"""But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock."" It was
so funny to hear my wife called ""Madam Mina"" by this kindly,
strong - faced old man. I smiled, and said: -  -"
345,11,70,"""I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already."""
345,11,71,"""And how?"""
345,11,72,"""By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything
took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the
evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know
what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been
the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted
myself. Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even
yourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours."" He
seemed pleased, and laughed as he said: -  -"

so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife."" I
would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded
and stood silent."
345,11,74,"""She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and
other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its
light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
egoist -  - and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
selfish. And you, sir -  - I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the
knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You
will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our

choky."

task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.

345,11,83,"I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous
night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the
train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to
catch something in one of them, ""The Westminster Gazette"" -  - I knew it by
the colour -  - and he grew quite white. He read something intently,
groaning to himself: ""Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!"" I do not
think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and
the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of
the window and waved his hand, calling out: ""Love to Madam Mina; I shall
write so soon as ever I can."""
345,11,84,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,11,85,"_26 September._ -  - Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week
since I said ""Finis,"" and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather
going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to
think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had
just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble
to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I
gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with
him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of
good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that
Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my
work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might
fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming
cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,
too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He
went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To - day he came
back, and almost bounded into the room at about half - past five o'clock,
and thrust last night's ""Westminster Gazette"" into my hand."
345,11,86,"""What do you think of that?"" he asked as he stood back and folded his
arms."
345,11,87,"I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he
took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed
away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a
passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An
idea struck me, and I looked up. ""Well?"" he said."
345,11,88,"""It is like poor Lucy's."""
345,11,89,"""And what do you make of it?"""
345,11,90,"""Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured
her has injured them."" I did not quite understand his answer: -  -"
345,11,91,"""That is true indirectly, but not directly."""
345,11,92,"""How do you mean, Professor?"" I asked. I was a little inclined to take
his seriousness lightly -  - for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits -  - but
when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our
despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern."
345,11,93,"""Tell me!"" I said. ""I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to
think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture."""
345,11,94,"""Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to
what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
events, but by me?"""
345,11,95,"""Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood."""
345,11,96,"""And how the blood lost or waste?"" I shook my head. He stepped over and
sat down beside me, and went on: -  -"
345,11,97,"""You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;
but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears
hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to
you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But
there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men's
eyes, because they know -  - or think they know -  - some things which other men
have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to
explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to
explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,
which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend
to be young -  - like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not
believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor
in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in
hypnotism -  -  -  - """
345,11,98,"""Yes,"" I said. ""Charcot has proved that pretty well."" He smiled as he
went on: ""Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you
understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
Charcot -  - alas that he is no more! -  - into the very soul of the patient
that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you
simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
be a blank? No? Then tell me -  - for I am student of the brain -  - how you
accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my
friend, that there are things done to - day in electrical science which
would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
electricity -  - who would themselves not so long before have been burned
as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that
Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred and
sixty - nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poor
veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we
could have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do
you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the
qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me
why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived
for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,
till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can
you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their
veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang
on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant
nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that
it is hot, flit down on them, and then -  - and then in the morning are
found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?"""
345,11,99,"""Good God, Professor!"" I said, starting up. ""Do you mean to tell me that
Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London
in the nineteenth century?"" He waved his hand for silence, and went
on: -  -"
345,11,100,"""Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and
why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are
some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
women who cannot die? We all know -  - because science has vouched for the
fact -  - that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die
and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the
corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men
come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian
fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?"" Here
I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind
his list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my
imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me
some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but
he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of
thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I
wanted to follow him, so I said: -  -"
345,11,101,"""Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so
that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in
my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an
idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping
from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without
knowing where I am going."""
345,11,102,"""That is good image,"" he said. ""Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is
this: I want you to believe."""
345,11,103,"""To believe what?"""
345,11,104,"""To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once
of an American who so defined faith: 'that faculty which enables us to
believe things which we know to be untrue.' For one, I follow that man.
He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of
truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway
truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value
him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
the universe."""
345,11,105,"""Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the
receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read
your lesson aright?"""
345,11,106,"""Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now
that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children's
throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?"""
345,11,107,"""I suppose so."" He stood up and said solemnly: -  -"
345,11,108,"""Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,
far, far worse."""
345,11,109,"""In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?"" I cried."
345,11,110,"He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his
elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke: -  -"
345,11,111,"""They were made by Miss Lucy!"""
345,12,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY -  - _continued_.
345,12,1,"For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life
struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to
him: -  -"
345,12,2,"""Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?"" He raised his head and looked at me, and
somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. ""Would I were!"" he
said. ""Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my
friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell
you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all
my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,
now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
fearful death? Ah no!"""
345,12,3,"""Forgive me,"" said I. He went on: -  -"
345,12,4,"""My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,
for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not
expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract
truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
believed the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To - night I go to prove
it. Dare you come with me?"""
345,12,5,"This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron
excepted from the category, jealousy."
345,12,6,"""And prove the very truth he most abhorred."""
345,12,7,"He saw my hesitation, and spoke: -  -"
345,12,8,"""The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock
to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;
at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet
very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,
I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child
in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers
say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were
in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he
will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we
wish to learn. And then -  -  -  - """
345,12,9,"""And then?"" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. ""And then we
spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is
the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin - man to give to
Arthur."" My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful
ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what
heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was
passing...."
345,12,10,"We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and
altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its
throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the
similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,
and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he
attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some
animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think
that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
heights of London. ""Out of so many harmless ones,"" he said, ""there may
be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some
sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from
the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred
there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago
a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a
week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the
Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare
came along, since when it has been quite a gala - time with them. Even
this poor little mite, when he woke up to - day, asked the nurse if he
might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted
to play with the 'bloofer lady.'"""
345,12,11,"""I hope,"" said Van Helsing, ""that when you are sending the child home
you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies
to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another
night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will
not let it away for some days?"""
345,12,12,"""Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not
healed."""
345,12,13,"Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it
was, he said: -  -"
345,12,14,"""There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek
somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way."""
345,12,15,"We dined at ""Jack Straw's Castle"" along with a little crowd of
bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock we
started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he
went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to
locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at
last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse
police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of
the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty -  - for
it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us -  - we found
the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,
and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to
precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the
courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My
companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,
one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he
fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,
proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day - time, and when wreathed
with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some
days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time - discoloured
stone, and dust - encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
brass, and clouded silver - plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life -  - animal life -  - was
not the only thing which could pass away."
345,12,16,"Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so
that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
made assurance of Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took
out a turnscrew."
345,12,17,"""What are you going to do?"" I asked."
345,12,18,"""To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced."" Straightway he began
taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed
to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took
hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: ""You shall see,"" and again
fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret - saw. Striking the turnscrew
through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of
the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week - old corpse. We
doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to
such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never
stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of
the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the
edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the
coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to
look."
345,12,19,I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.
345,12,20,"It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but
Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,
and so emboldened to proceed in his task. ""Are you satisfied now, friend
John?"" he asked."
345,12,21,"I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as
I answered him: -  -"
345,12,22,"""I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only
proves one thing."""
345,12,23,"""And what is that, friend John?"""
345,12,24,"""That it is not there."""
345,12,25,"""That is good logic,"" he said, ""so far as it goes. But how do you -  - how
can you -  - account for it not being there?"""
345,12,26,"""Perhaps a body - snatcher,"" I suggested. ""Some of the undertaker's people
may have stolen it."" I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was
the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. ""Ah
well!"" he said, ""we must have more proof. Come with me."""
345,12,27,"He put on the coffin - lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and
locked it. He handed me the key, saying: ""Will you keep it? You had
better be assured."" I laughed -  - it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am
bound to say -  - as I motioned him to keep it. ""A key is nothing,"" I said;
""there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock
of that kind."" He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he
told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at
the other. I took up my place behind a yew - tree, and I saw his dark
figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
sight."
345,12,28,"It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant
clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and
unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand
and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had
a dreary, miserable time."
345,12,29,"Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white
streak, moving between two dark yew - trees at the side of the churchyard
farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the
Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I
too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed - off tombs, and I
stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an
early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered
juniper - trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim
figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden
by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the
rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When
he saw me he held it out to me, and said: -  -"
345,12,30,"""Are you satisfied now?"""
345,12,31,"""No,"" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive."
345,12,32,"""Do you not see the child?"""
345,12,33,"""Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?"" I
asked."
345,12,34,"""We shall see,"" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way
out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child."
345,12,35,"When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of
trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was
without a scratch or scar of any kind."
345,12,36,"""Was I right?"" I asked triumphantly."
345,12,37,"""We were just in time,"" said the Professor thankfully."
345,12,38,"We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted
about it. If we were to take it to a police - station we should have to
give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should
have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.
So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we
heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find
it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out
well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy
tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation
of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a
cab near the ""Spaniards,"" and drove to town."
345,12,39,"I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'
sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall
go with him on another expedition."
345,12,40,*       *       *       *       *
345,12,41,"_27 September._ -  - It was two o'clock before we found a suitable
opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,
and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder - trees, we saw
the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till
morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not
want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the
reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were
incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.
Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead
nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to
open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,
and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,
no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again
courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as
last night, but oh, how unutterably mean - looking when the sunshine
streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.
He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock
of surprise and dismay shot through me."
345,12,42,"There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I
could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than
before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom."
345,12,43,"""Is this a juggle?"" I said to him."
345,12,44,"""Are you convinced now?"" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke
he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the
dead lips and showed the white teeth."
345,12,45,"""See,"" he went on, ""see, they are even sharper than before. With this
and this"" -  - and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below
it -  - ""the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend
John?"" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not
accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to
argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said: -  -"
345,12,46,"""She may have been placed here since last night."""
345,12,47,"""Indeed? That is so, and by whom?"""
345,12,48,"""I do not know. Some one has done it."""
345,12,49,"""And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not
look so."" I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not
seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor
triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising
the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and
examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said: -  -"
345,12,50,"""Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is
some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire
when she was in a trance, sleep - walking -  - oh, you start; you do not know
that, friend John, but you shall know it all later -  - and in trance could
he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she
is Un - Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when
the Un - Dead sleep at home"" -  - as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of
his arm to designate what to a vampire was ""home"" -  - ""their face show what
they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un - Dead she go back to
the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so
it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep."" This turned my blood
cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's
theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the
idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in
my face, for he said almost joyously: -  -"
345,12,51,"""Ah, you believe now?"""
345,12,52,"I answered: ""Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to
accept. How will you do this bloody work?"""
345,12,53,"""I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall
drive a stake through her body."" It made me shudder to think of so
mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling
was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to
shudder at the presence of this being, this Un - Dead, as Van Helsing
called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,
or all objective?"
345,12,54,"I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as
if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a
snap, and said: -  -"
345,12,55,"""I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I
did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is
to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are
thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is
simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act
now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to
want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the
wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at
the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
to - day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
beautiful in a whole week, after she die -  - if you know of this and know
of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,
and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect
Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I
took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me
because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say
good - bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea
this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet
he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will
sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint
his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he
will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
an Un - Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since
I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he
must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,
must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to
him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is
made up. Let us go. You return home for to - night to your asylum, and see
that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this
churchyard in my own way. To - morrow night you will come to me to the
Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,
and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we
shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and
there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set."""
345,12,56,"So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly."
345,12,57,"_Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to
John Seward, M. D._"
345,12,58,(Not delivered.)
345,12,59,"""_27 September._"
345,12,60,"""Friend John, -  -"
345,12,61,"""I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in
that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un - Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not
leave to - night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.
Therefore I shall fix some things she like not -  - garlic and a
crucifix -  - and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un - Dead,
and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they
may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un - Dead is
desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may
be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,
and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss
Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that
she is Un - Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.
He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all
along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy's life, and
we lost; and in many ways the Un - Dead are strong. He have always the
strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength
to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and
I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall
find me; but none other shall -  - until it be too late. But it may be that
he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his
hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the
Un - Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch."
345,12,62,"""Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,
the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
great Un - Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake
through it, so that the world may rest from him."
345,12,63,"""If it be so, farewell."
345,12,64,"""VAN HELSING."""
345,12,65,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,12,66,"_28 September._ -  - It is wonderful what a good night's sleep will do for
one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrous
ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on
common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his
mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_
rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that
the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that
if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to
some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed
it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van
Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some
light on the mystery."
345,12,67,*       *       *       *       *
345,12,68,"_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o'clock,
Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room; he told us all that he
wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all
our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would
all come with him too, ""for,"" he said, ""there is a grave duty to be done
there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?"" This query was
directly addressed to Lord Godalming."
345,12,69,"""I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble
around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been
curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the
more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself
that I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything."""
345,12,70,"""Me too,"" said Quincey Morris laconically."
345,12,71,"""Oh,"" said the Professor, ""then you are nearer the beginning, both of
you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can
even get so far as to begin."""
345,12,72,"It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said
with intense gravity: -  -"
345,12,73,"""I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I
know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will
know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me
in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a
time -  - I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
be -  - you shall not blame yourselves for anything."""
345,12,74,"""That's frank anyhow,"" broke in Quincey. ""I'll answer for the Professor.
I don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest; and that's good
enough for me."""
345,12,75,"""I thank you, sir,"" said Van Helsing proudly. ""I have done myself the
honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear
to me."" He held out a hand, which Quincey took."
345,12,76,Then Arthur spoke out: -  -
345,12,77,"""Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like to 'buy a pig in a poke,' as they
say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman
or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.
If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of
these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I
cannot understand what you are driving at."""
345,12,78,"""I accept your limitation,"" said Van Helsing, ""and all I ask of you is
that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first
consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
reservations."""
345,12,79,"""Agreed!"" said Arthur; ""that is only fair. And now that the
_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?"""
345,12,80,"""I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at
Kingstead."""
345,12,81,Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way: -  -
345,12,82,"""Where poor Lucy is buried?"" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: ""And
when there?"""
345,12,83,"""To enter the tomb!"" Arthur stood up."
345,12,84,"""Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,
I see that you are in earnest."" He sat down again, but I could see that
he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was
silence until he asked again: -  -"
345,12,85,"""And when in the tomb?"""
345,12,86,"""To open the coffin."""
345,12,87,"""This is too much!"" he said, angrily rising again. ""I am willing to be
patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this -  - this desecration
of the grave -  - of one who -  -  -  - "" He fairly choked with indignation. The
Professor looked pityingly at him."
345,12,88,"""If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,"" he said, ""God knows I
would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and
for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!"""
345,12,89,Arthur looked up with set white face and said: -  -
345,12,90,"""Take care, sir, take care!"""
345,12,91,"""Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?"" said Van Helsing.
""And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go
on?"""
345,12,92,"""That's fair enough,"" broke in Morris."
345,12,93,"After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort: -  -"
345,12,94,"""Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to
her. But if she be not dead -  -  -  - """
345,12,95,Arthur jumped to his feet.
345,12,96,"""Good God!"" he cried. ""What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has
she been buried alive?"" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could
soften."
345,12,97,"""I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no
further than to say that she might be Un - Dead."""
345,12,98,"""Un - Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what
is it?"""
345,12,99,"""There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But
I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?"""
345,12,100,"""Heavens and earth, no!"" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. ""Not for
the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.
Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should
torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to
cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or
am I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such a
desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a
duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do
it!"""
345,12,101,"Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and
said, gravely and sternly: -  -"
345,12,102,"""My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty
to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you
now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when
later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
fulfilment even than I am, then -  - then I shall do my duty, whatever it
may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship's wishes I shall
hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where
you will."" His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of
pity: -  -"
345,12,103,"""But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of
acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring
my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if
the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from
you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can
to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so
much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land
to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and
then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her -  - I
am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness -  - I gave what you
gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her
lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights
and days -  - before death, after death; and if my death can do her good
even now, when she is the dead Un - Dead, she shall have it freely."" He
said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected
by it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice: -  -"
345,12,104,"""Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I
shall go with you and wait."""
345,13,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY -  - _continued_
345,13,1,"It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the
churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams
of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across
the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly
in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked
well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so
sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it
that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant
to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural
hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by
entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.
He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped
forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me: -  -"
345,13,2,"""You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that
coffin?"""
345,13,3,"""It was."" The Professor turned to the rest saying: -  -"
345,13,4,"""You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me."" He
took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur
looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped
forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,
at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,
the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.
Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
recoiled."
345,13,5,The coffin was empty!
345,13,6,"For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by
Quincey Morris: -  -"
345,13,7,"""Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask
such a thing ordinarily -  - I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a
doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
Is this your doing?"""
345,13,8,"""I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor
touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and
I came here -  - with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which
was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and
saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in
day - time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?"""
345,13,9,"""Yes."""
345,13,10,"""That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,
and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came
here before sundown, for at sundown the Un - Dead can move. I waited here
all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable
that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
which the Un - Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last
night there was no exodus, so to - night before the sundown I took away my
garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But
bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me
outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
So"" -  - here he shut the dark slide of his lantern -  - ""now to the outside.""
He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the
door behind him."
345,13,11,"Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing
gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
passing -  - like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was
to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how
humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to
hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each
in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I
could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the
mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to
throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey
Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and
accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to
stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good - sized plug of
tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a
definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like
thin, wafer - like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white
napkin; next he took out a double - handful of some whitish stuff, like
dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin
strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near
also, as they too were curious. He answered: -  -"
345,13,12,"""I am closing the tomb, so that the Un - Dead may not enter."""
345,13,13,"""And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?"" asked Quincey.
""Great Scott! Is this a game?"""
345,13,14,"""It is."""
345,13,15,"""What is that which you are using?"" This time the question was by
Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered: -  -"
345,13,16,"""The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence."" It was an
answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually
that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a
purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was
impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places
assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself
been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,
who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink
within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or
yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree
or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so
mysteriously; and never did the far - away howling of dogs send such a
woeful presage through the night."
345,13,17,"There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the
Professor a keen ""S - s - s - s!"" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews
we saw a white figure advance -  - a dim white figure, which held something
dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of
moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling
prominence a dark - haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.
We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a
fair - haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a
child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We
were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as
he stood behind a yew - tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the
white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see
clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,
and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of
Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was
turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous
wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we
all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the
tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the
concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips
were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her
chin and stained the purity of her lawn death - robe."
345,13,18,"We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even
Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had
not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen."
345,13,19,"When Lucy -  - I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her
shape -  - saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives
when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form
and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell - fire, instead of
the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love
passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have
done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,
how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to
the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had
clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls
over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There
was a cold - bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when
she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell
back and hid his face in his hands."
345,13,20,"She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,
said: -  -"
345,13,21,"""Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are
hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!"""
345,13,22,"There was something diabolically sweet in her tones -  - something of the
tingling of glass when struck -  - which rang through the brains even of us
who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under
a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She
was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between
them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a
suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter
the tomb."
345,13,23,"When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if
arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was
shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no
quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled
malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by
mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw
out sparks of hell - fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of
the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,
blood - stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death -  - if looks could
kill -  - we saw it at that moment."
345,13,24,"And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur: -  -"
345,13,25,"""Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?"""
345,13,26,"Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
answered: -  -"
345,13,27,"""Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like
this ever any more;"" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I
simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the
click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close
to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified
amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal
body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
where scarce a knife - blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of
relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
to the edges of the door."
345,13,28,"When this was done, he lifted the child and said:"
345,13,29,"""Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to - morrow. There is a
funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The
friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of
to - night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to - morrow
night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find
him, as on the other night; and then to home."" Coming close to Arthur,
he said: -  -"
345,13,30,"""My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look
back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter
waters, my child. By this time to - morrow you will, please God, have
passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me."""
345,13,31,"Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
slept with more or less reality of sleep."
345,13,32,*       *       *       *       *
345,13,33,"_29 September, night._ -  - A little before twelve o'clock we three -  - Arthur,
Quincey Morris, and myself -  - called for the Professor. It was odd to
notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of
course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of
us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half - past one, and
strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
fair weight."
345,13,34,"When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it
behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also
two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own
ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work
by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked -  - Arthur
trembling like an aspen -  - and saw that the body lay there in all its
death - beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but
loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her
soul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently
he said to Van Helsing: -  -"
345,13,35,"""Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?"""
345,13,36,"""It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her
as she was, and is."""
345,13,37,"She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,
the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth -  - which it made one shudder to
see -  - the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual
methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some
plumbing solder, and then a small oil - lamp, which gave out, when lit in
a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue
flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a
round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about
three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and
was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such
as in households is used in the coal - cellar for breaking the lumps. To
me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and
bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was
to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their
courage, and remained silent and quiet."
345,13,38,"When all was ready, Van Helsing said: -  -"
345,13,39,"""Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and
experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
of the Un - Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the
curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
die from the preying of the Un - Dead becomes themselves Un - Dead, and prey
on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the
ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met
that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night
when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,
have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would
all time make more of those Un - Deads that so have fill us with horror.
The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those
children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if
she live on, Un - Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her
power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that
so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny
wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when
this now Un - Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor
lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by
night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she
shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will
be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better
right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the
night when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it
was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there be
such a one amongst us?"""
345,13,40,"We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore
Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and
said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as
snow: -  -"
345,13,41,"""My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me
what I am to do, and I shall not falter!"" Van Helsing laid a hand on his
shoulder, and said: -  -"
345,13,42,"""Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be
driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal -  - be not deceived in
that -  - but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more
than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only
think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
you all the time."""
345,13,43,"""Go on,"" said Arthur hoarsely. ""Tell me what I am to do."""
345,13,44,"""Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for
the dead -  - I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall
follow -  - strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that
we love and that the Un - Dead pass away."""
345,13,45,"Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened
his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we
could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could
see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might."
345,13,46,"The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood - curdling screech
came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted
in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur
never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm
rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy - bearing stake, whilst
the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His
face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it
gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
vault."
345,13,47,"And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the
teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The
terrible task was over."
345,13,48,"The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would have fallen had
we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,
and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain
on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human
considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few
minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one
to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had
been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,
strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of
horror that lay upon it."
345,13,49,"There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded
and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a
privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in
her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that
there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth
to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like
sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and
symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever."
345,13,50,"Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to
him: -  -"
345,13,51,"""And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?"""
345,13,52,"The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand
in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said: -  -"
345,13,53,"""Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,
and me peace."" He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying
his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood
unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him: -  -"
345,13,54,"""And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as
she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning
devil now -  - not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is
the devil's Un - Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!"""
345,13,55,"Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the
tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point
of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with
garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin - lid,
and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked
the door he gave the key to Arthur."
345,13,56,"Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was
gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy."
345,13,57,Before we moved away Van Helsing said: -  -
345,13,58,"""Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author
of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can
follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in
it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all
of us -  - is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do
we not promise to go on to the bitter end?"""
345,13,59,"Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the
Professor as we moved off: -  -"
345,13,60,"""Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of
the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you
know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans
unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult
about, and you can help me. To - night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall
return to - morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I
shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.
Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a
terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we
must not draw back."""
345,14,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY -  - _continued_
345,14,1,"When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram
waiting for him: -  -"
345,14,2,"""Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news. -  - MINA
HARKER."""
345,14,3,"The Professor was delighted. ""Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,"" he said,
""pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your
house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en
route_, so that she may be prepared."""
345,14,4,"When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of
a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten
copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby. ""Take these,"" he
said, ""and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of
all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep
them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your
faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to - day. What
is here told,"" he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of
papers as he spoke, ""may be the beginning of the end to you and me and
many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un - Dead who walk the
earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in
any way to the story here told do so, for it is all - important. You have
kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we
shall go through all these together when we meet."" He then made ready
for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I
took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before
the train came in."
345,14,5,"The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival
platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my
guest, when a sweet - faced, dainty - looking girl stepped up to me, and,
after a quick glance, said: ""Dr. Seward, is it not?"""
345,14,6,"""And you are Mrs. Harker!"" I answered at once; whereupon she held out
her hand."
345,14,7,"""I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but -  -  -  - "" She stopped
suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face."
345,14,8,"The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it
was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a
typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had
sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting - room and bedroom
prepared at once for Mrs. Harker."
345,14,9,"In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a
lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder
when we entered."
345,14,10,"She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as
she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph
diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at
the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before
me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an
opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or
what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here
she is!"
345,14,11,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,14,12,"_29 September._ -  - After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward's
study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking
with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at
the door, and on his calling out, ""Come in,"" I entered."
345,14,13,"To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,
and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the
description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much
interested."
345,14,14,"""I hope I did not keep you waiting,"" I said; ""but I stayed at the door
as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you."""
345,14,15,"""Oh,"" he replied with a smile, ""I was only entering my diary."""
345,14,16,"""Your diary?"" I asked him in surprise."
345,14,17,"""Yes,"" he answered. ""I keep it in this."" As he spoke he laid his hand on
the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out: -  -"
345,14,18,"""Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?"""
345,14,19,"""Certainly,"" he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face."
345,14,20,"""The fact is,"" he began awkwardly, ""I only keep my diary in it; and as
it is entirely -  - almost entirely -  - about my cases, it may be awkward -  - that
is, I mean -  -  -  - "" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his
embarrassment: -  -"
345,14,21,"""You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;
for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very
dear to me."""
345,14,22,"To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face: -  -"
345,14,23,"""Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!"""
345,14,24,"""Why not?"" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.
At length he stammered out: -  -"
345,14,25,"""You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
diary."" Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said
with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté
of a child: ""That's quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!"" I could
not but smile, at which he grimaced. ""I gave myself away that time!"" he
said. ""But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months
past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular
part of it in case I wanted to look it up?"" By this time my mind was
made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have
something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and
I said boldly: -  -"
345,14,26,"""Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my
typewriter."" He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said: -  -"
345,14,27,"""No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terrible
story!"""
345,14,28,"Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,
and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on
the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,
followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning."
345,14,29,"""You do not know me,"" I said. ""When you have read those papers -  - my own
diary and my husband's also, which I have typed -  - you will know me
better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
this cause; but, of course, you do not know me -  - yet; and I must not
expect you to trust me so far."""
345,14,30,"He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about
him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in
order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
said: -  -"
345,14,31,"""You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.
But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long
ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make
the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them -  - the
first half - dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify
you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the
meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better
able to understand certain things."" He carried the phonograph himself up
to my sitting - room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something
pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love
episode of which I know one side already...."
345,14,32,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,14,33,"_29 September._ -  - I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan
Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without
thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce
dinner, so I said: ""She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,"" and
I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when
she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were
flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had
cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went
straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could: -  -"
345,14,34,"""I greatly fear I have distressed you."""
345,14,35,"""Oh, no, not distressed me,"" she replied, ""but I have been more touched
than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is
cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them
spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the
words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as
I did."""
345,14,36,"""No one need ever know, shall ever know,"" I said in a low voice. She
laid her hand on mine and said very gravely: -  -"
345,14,37,"""Ah, but they must!"""
345,14,38,"""Must! But why?"" I asked."
345,14,39,"""Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy's
death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all
the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the
cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;
but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark
mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain
point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,
how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought
out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van
Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he
will be here to - morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;
working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than
if some of us were in the dark."" She looked at me so appealingly, and at
the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,
that I gave in at once to her wishes. ""You shall,"" I said, ""do as you
like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible
things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to
poor Lucy's death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the
dark. Nay, the end -  - the very end -  - may give you a gleam of peace. Come,
there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;
we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn
the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask -  - if there be anything
which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were
present."""
345,14,40,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,14,41,"_29 September._ -  - After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He
brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He
placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I
could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case
I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his
back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I
put the forked metal to my ears and listened."
345,14,42,"When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and -  - and all that followed, was
done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a
fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a
horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case - bottle from a
cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored
me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all
the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy
was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without
making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I
had not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not have
believed. As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my
difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my
typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward: -  -"
345,14,43,"""Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing
when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when
he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,
and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that
Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him
when they come."" He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I
began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used
manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with
all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about
his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he
came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely
whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of
good men -  - even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I
remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor's
perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the
files of ""The Westminster Gazette"" and ""The Pall Mall Gazette,"" and took
them to my room. I remember how much ""The Dailygraph"" and ""The Whitby
Gazette,"" of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the
terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look
through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new
light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet."
345,14,44,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,14,45,"_30 September._ -  - Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock. He had got his
wife's wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can
judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true -  - and
judging by one's own wonderful experiences, it must be -  - he is also a man
of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a
remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was
prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
business - like gentleman who came here to - day."
345,14,46,*       *       *       *       *
345,14,47,"_Later._ -  - After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,
and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They
are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in
chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got
the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the
carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife's
typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it
is...."
345,14,48,"Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be
the Count's hiding - place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues
from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters
relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,
if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!
Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again
collating his material. He says that by dinner - time they will be
able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the
meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of
index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,
but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing
that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have
found the dates otherwise...."
345,14,49,"I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands
folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any
one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of
subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own
accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my
knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite
confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I
not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of
his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a
brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All
those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that
his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?
Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the
chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of ""master."" This
all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came
away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it
safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,
and then -  - ! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so
I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to
have a strait - waistcoat ready in case of need."
345,14,50,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._
345,14,51,"_29 September, in train to London._ -  - When I received Mr. Billington's
courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I
thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such
inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
of the Count's to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal
with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and
brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must
stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:
give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all
knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had
ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.
It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had
seen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.
Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which
might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried
out. To use an Americanism, he had ""taken no chances,"" and the absolute
accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the
logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:
""Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.""
Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of
these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could
give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs
officers and the harbour - master. They had all something to say of the
strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
tradition; but no one could add to the simple description ""Fifty cases
of common earth."" I then saw the station - master, who kindly put me in
communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their
tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that
the boxes were ""main and mortal heavy,"" and that shifting them was dry
work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any
gentleman ""such - like as yourself, squire,"" to show some sort of
appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider
that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had
elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care
before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of
reproach."
345,14,52,*       *       *       *       *
345,14,53,"_30 September._ -  - The station - master was good enough to give me a line to
his old companion the station - master at King's Cross, so that when I
arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of
the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper
officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original
invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here
limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was
compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner."
345,14,54,"From thence I went on to Carter Paterson's central office, where I met
with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their
day - book and letter - book, and at once telephoned to their King's Cross
office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming
were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
also by one of them the way - bill and all the papers connected with the
delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing
exactly; the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the
written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected
almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent
thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,
through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a
later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked: -  -"
345,14,55,"""That 'ere 'ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it
ain't been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in
the place that you might have slep' on it without 'urtin' of yer bones;
an' the place was that neglected that yer might 'ave smelled ole
Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel -  - that took the cike, that did! Me
and my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough. Lor', I
wouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark."""
345,14,56,"Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what
I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms."
345,14,57,"Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at
Whitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old
chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have
since been removed -  - as from Dr. Seward's diary I fear."
345,14,58,"I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when
Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good
deal."
345,14,59,*       *       *       *       *
345,14,60,"_Later._ -  - Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers
into order."
345,14,61,_Mina Harker's Journal_
345,14,62,"_30 September._ -  - I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.
It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:
that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a
face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,
however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never
so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good
Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under
strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and
hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to - night. I
feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any
thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not
human -  - not even beast. To read Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy's
death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in
one's heart."
345,14,63,*       *       *       *       *
345,14,64,"_Later._ -  - Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we
expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with
him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it
brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago. Of
course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van
Helsing, too, has been quite ""blowing my trumpet,"" as Mr. Morris
expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all
about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to
say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they
had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and
came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post
them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that
they had been at Lucy's death -  - her real death -  - and that I need not fear
to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I
could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband
and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got
his and turned it over -  - it does make a pretty good pile -  - he said: -  -"
345,14,65,"""Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?"""
345,14,66,"I nodded, and he went on: -  -"
345,14,67,"""I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all
I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have
had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble
to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy -  - ""
Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear
the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid
a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the
room. I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man
free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or
emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when
Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and
gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I
hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it
afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I
_know_ he never will -  - he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I
could see that his heart was breaking: -  -"
345,14,68,"""I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to
her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let
me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have
had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can
help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service -  - for
Lucy's sake?"""
345,14,69,"In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed
to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a
vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat
his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat
down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite
pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his
head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with
emotion."
345,14,70,"We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
smaller matters when the mother - spirit is invoked; I felt this big
sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he
were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was."
345,14,71,"After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an
apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for
days and nights past -  - weary days and sleepless nights -  - he had been
unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of
sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with
whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
surrounded, he could speak freely. ""I know now how I suffered,"" he said,
as he dried his eyes, ""but I do not know even yet -  - and none other can
ever know -  - how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to - day. I shall
know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful
now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be
like a brother, will you not, for all our lives -  - for dear Lucy's sake?"""
345,14,72,"""For dear Lucy's sake,"" I said as we clasped hands. ""Ay, and for your
own sake,"" he added, ""for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth
the winning, you have won mine to - day. If ever the future should bring
to you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call
in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the
sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you
will let me know."" He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that
I felt it would comfort him, so I said: -  -"
345,14,73,"""I promise."""
345,14,74,"As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.
He turned as he heard my footsteps. ""How is Art?"" he said. Then noticing
my red eyes, he went on: ""Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor
old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in
trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him."""
345,14,75,"He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the
manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise
how much I knew; so I said to him: -  -"
345,14,76,"""I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me
be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You
will know, later on, why I speak."" He saw that I was in earnest, and
stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed
but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I
bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a
momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly: -  -"
345,14,77,"""Little girl, you will never regret that true - hearted kindness, so long
as ever you live!"" Then he went into the study to his friend."
345,14,78,"""Little girl!"" -  - the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he
proved himself a friend!"
345,15,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
345,15,1,"_30 September._ -  - I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming
and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife
had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the
carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave
us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I
have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had
finished, Mrs. Harker said: -  -"
345,15,2,"""Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.
Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary
interests me so much!"" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I
could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so
I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a
lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: ""Why?"""
345,15,3,"""She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,"" I
answered. ""Oh, very well,"" he said; ""let her come in, by all means; but
just wait a minute till I tidy up the place."" His method of tidying was
peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was
jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting
task, he said cheerfully: ""Let the lady come in,"" and sat down on the
edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might
have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just
before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I
could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She
came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command
the respect of any lunatic -  - for easiness is one of the qualities mad
people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and
held out her hand."
345,15,4,"""Good - evening, Mr. Renfield,"" said she. ""You see, I know you, for Dr.
Seward has told me of you."" He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all
over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one
of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he
said: -  -"
345,15,5,"""You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,
you know, for she's dead."" Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied: -  -"
345,15,6,"""Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker."""
345,15,7,"""Then what are you doing here?"""
345,15,8,"""My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward."""
345,15,9,"""Then don't stay."""
345,15,10,"""But why not?"" I thought that this style of conversation might not be
pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in: -  -"
345,15,11,"""How did you know I wanted to marry any one?"" His reply was simply
contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.
Harker to me, instantly turning them back again: -  -"
345,15,12,"""What an asinine question!"""
345,15,13,"""I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield,"" said Mrs. Harker, at once
championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
he had shown contempt to me: -  -"
345,15,14,"""You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so
loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of
interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his
household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of
them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I
cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_."" I
positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet
lunatic -  - the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met
with -  - talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished
gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched
some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any
way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or
power."
345,15,15,"We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly
quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she
began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for
he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned
certain things."
345,15,16,"""Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,
it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being
put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and
perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no
matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong
life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to
take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I
tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by
the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his
blood -  - relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is
the life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has
vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,
doctor?"" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to
either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up
his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I
saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.
Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying
pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: ""Good - bye, and I hope I may see you often,
under auspices pleasanter to yourself,"" to which, to my astonishment, he
replied: -  -"
345,15,17,"""Good - bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.
May He bless and keep you!"""
345,15,18,"When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind
me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took
ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for
many a long day."
345,15,19,"Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying: -  -"
345,15,20,"""Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come
here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have
much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And
Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!"""
345,15,21,"As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own
diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; at
which the Professor interrupted me: -  -"
345,15,22,"""Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain -  - a brain that a man
should have were he much gifted -  - and a woman's heart. The good God
fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good
combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
to us; after to - night she must not have to do with this so terrible
affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are
determined -  - nay, are we not pledged? -  - to destroy this monster; but it is
no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer -  - both in
waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,
she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to
think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she
must consult with us; but to - morrow she say good - bye to this work, and
we go alone."" I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we
had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was
the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed
to come on him. ""Oh that we had known it before!"" he said, ""for then we
might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk
that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think
of that, but go on our way to the end."" Then he fell into a silence that
lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for
dinner he said to Mrs. Harker: -  -"
345,15,23,"""I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have
put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment."""
345,15,24,"""Not up to this moment, Professor,"" she said impulsively, ""but up to
this morning."""
345,15,25,"""But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the
little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who
has told is the worse for it."""
345,15,26,"Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she
said: -  -"
345,15,27,"""Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It
is my record of to - day. I too have seen the need of putting down at
present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
what is personal. Must it go in?"" The Professor read it over gravely,
and handed it back, saying: -  -"
345,15,28,"""It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can
but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more
honour you -  - as well as more esteem and love."" She took it back with
another blush and a bright smile."
345,15,29,"And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us
have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
terrible and mysterious enemy."
345,15,30,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,15,31,"_30 September._ -  - When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after
dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of
board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to
which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit
next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat
next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.
Morris -  - Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the
centre. The Professor said: -  -"
345,15,32,"""I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
that are in these papers."" We all expressed assent, and he went on: -  -"
345,15,33,"""Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of
enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.
So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
according."
345,15,34,"""There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they
exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the
teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that
through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not
have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see!
I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know -  - nay,
had I even guess at him -  - one so precious life had been spared to many of
us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other
poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die
like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being
stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is
amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of
cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have
still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the
divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are
for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in
callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear
at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he
can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the
thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and
the bat -  - the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become
small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to
begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having
found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible
task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave
shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then
where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not
mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward
become foul things of the night like him -  - without heart or conscience,
preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for
ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?
We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's
sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face
to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;
but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his
song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are
young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What
say you?"""
345,15,35,"Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so
much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I
saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch -  - so
strong, so self - reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for
itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music."
345,15,36,"When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I
in his; there was no need for speaking between us."
345,15,37,"""I answer for Mina and myself,"" he said."
345,15,38,"""Count me in, Professor,"" said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual."
345,15,39,"""I am with you,"" said Lord Godalming, ""for Lucy's sake, if for no other
reason."""
345,15,40,"Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his
golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took
his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with
his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our
solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even
occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing
went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work
had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,
as any other transaction of life: -  -"
345,15,41,"""Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
without strength. We have on our side power of combination -  - a power
denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to
act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
free to use them. We have self - devotion in a cause, and an end to
achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much."
345,15,42,"""Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the
limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular."
345,15,43,"""All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not
at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death -  - nay
of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the
first place because we have to be -  - no other means is at our control -  - and
secondly, because, after all, these things -  - tradition and
superstition -  - are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for
others -  - though not, alas! for us -  - on them? A year ago which of us would
have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
sceptical, matter - of - fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief
that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the
vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere
that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany
all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so
far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at
this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the
devil - begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we
have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the
beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the
time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the
living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he
cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend
Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again
Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand -  - witness again
Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him
from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John
saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at
the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create -  - that noble
ship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance
he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He
come on moonlight rays as elemental dust -  - as again Jonathan saw those
sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small -  - we ourselves saw
Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the
tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or
into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with
fire -  - solder you call it. He can see in the dark -  - no small power this,
in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me
through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even
more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.
He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey
some of nature's laws -  - why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the
first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;
though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does
that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times
can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is
bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.
These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by
inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he
have his earth - home, his coffin - home, his hell - home, the place
unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at
Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is
said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood
of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no
power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this
symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to
them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and
silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,
lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his
coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the
coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through
him, we know already of its peace; or the cut - off head that giveth rest.
We have seen it with our eyes."
345,15,44,"""Thus when we find the habitation of this man - that - was, we can confine
him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is
clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda - Pesth University, to
make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he
has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his
name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
Turkey - land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,
and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most
cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the
forest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his
grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says
Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who
were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They
learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake
Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the
records are such words as 'stregoica' -  - witch, 'ordog,' and
'pokol' -  - Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is
spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. There have been
from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their
graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it
is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in
all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest."""
345,15,45,"Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,
and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little
pause, and then the Professor went on: -  -"
345,15,46,"""And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must
proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan
that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes
have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to
ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
where we look to - day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
latter, we must trace -  -  -  - """
345,15,47,"Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came
the sound of a pistol - shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a
bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the
far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked
out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the
window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice
without: -  -"
345,15,48,"""Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about
it."" A minute later he came in and said: -  -"
345,15,49,"""It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.
Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But
the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat
and sat on the window - sill. I have got such a horror of the damned
brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to
have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have
seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art."""
345,15,50,"""Did you hit it?"" asked Dr. Van Helsing."
345,15,51,"""I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood."" Without
saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his
statement: -  -"
345,15,52,"""We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.
Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak."
345,15,53,"""And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.
You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to - night, you
no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men
and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
are."""
345,15,54,"All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me
good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
safety -  - strength being the best safety -  - through care of me; but their
minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,
I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me."
345,15,55,Mr. Morris resumed the discussion: -  -
345,15,56,"""As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right
now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
another victim."""
345,15,57,"I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so
close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I
appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave
me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,
with means to get into the house."
345,15,58,"Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can
sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend
to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns."
345,15,59,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,15,60,"_1 October, 4 a. m._ -  - Just as we were about to leave the house, an
urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see
him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the
morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added: -  -"
345,15,61,"""He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don't
know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his
violent fits."" I knew the man would not have said this without some
cause, so I said: ""All right; I'll go now""; and I asked the others to
wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my ""patient."""
345,15,62,"""Take me with you, friend John,"" said the Professor. ""His case in your
diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_
case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is
disturbed."""
345,15,63,"""May I come also?"" asked Lord Godalming."
345,15,64,"""Me too?"" said Quincey Morris. ""May I come?"" said Harker. I nodded, and
we all went down the passage together."
345,15,65,"We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more
rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an
unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever
met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would
prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but
none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would
at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up
with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own
existing sanity. ""I appeal to your friends,"" he said, ""they will,
perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have
not introduced me."" I was so much astonished, that the oddness of
introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,
besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of
the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: ""Lord
Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.
Renfield."" He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn: -  -"
345,15,66,"""Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the
Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no
more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his
youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much
patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great
state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have
far - reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold
alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a
vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true
place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at
meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of
conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics
by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain - matter,
conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to
one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by
the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective
places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at
least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico - jurist as
well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to
be considered as under exceptional circumstances."" He made this last
appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
charm."
345,15,67,"I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the
conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,
that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to
tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the
necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it
better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old
I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared
to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him
in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of
meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said
quickly: -  -"
345,15,68,"""But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to
go at once -  - here -  - now -  - this very hour -  - this very moment, if I may. Time
presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of
the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put
before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so
momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment."" He looked at me keenly, and
seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised
them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on: -  -"
345,15,69,"""Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?"""
345,15,70,"""You have,"" I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.
There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly: -  -"
345,15,71,"""Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for
this concession -  - boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore
in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I
am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I
assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and
unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,
sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which
animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of
your friends."" Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing
conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was
but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let
him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like
all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at
him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting
with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone
which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it
afterwards -  - for it was as of one addressing an equal: -  -"
345,15,72,"""Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
to - night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me -  - a stranger,
without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind -  - Dr.
Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the
privilege you seek."" He shook his head sadly, and with a look of
poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on: -  -"
345,15,73,"""Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the
highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since
you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If
you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can
we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help
us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish."" He still shook
his head as he said: -  -"
345,15,74,"""Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and
if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my
own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am
refused, the responsibility does not rest with me."" I thought it was now
time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went
towards the door, simply saying: -  -"
345,15,75,"""Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good - night."""
345,15,76,"As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He
moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was
about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were
groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his
petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,
and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more
fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his
efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same
constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of
which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he
wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same
sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,
for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into
quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up
his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a
torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his
whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion: -  -"
345,15,77,"""Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out
of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;
send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a
strait - waistcoat, manacled and leg - ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go
out of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I am
speaking from the depths of my heart -  - of my very soul. You don't know
whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
By all you hold sacred -  - by all you hold dear -  - by your love that is
lost -  - by your hope that lives -  - for the sake of the Almighty, take me out
of this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you
understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and
earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting
for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!"""
345,15,78,"I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so
would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up."
345,15,79,"""Come,"" I said sternly, ""no more of this; we have had quite enough
already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly."""
345,15,80,"He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,
without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the
bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had
expected."
345,15,81,"When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a
quiet, well - bred voice: -  -"
345,15,82,"""You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later
on, that I did what I could to convince you to - night."""
345,16,0,JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL
345,16,1,"_1 October, 5 a. m._ -  - I went with the party to the search with an easy
mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am
so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at
all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and
brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way
that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and
that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a
little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his
room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said
to Dr. Seward: -  -"
345,16,2,"""Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the
sanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some
serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
chance."" Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added: -  -"
345,16,3,"""Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,
for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last
hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in
our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.
All is best as they are."" Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a
dreamy kind of way: -  -"
345,16,4,"""I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an
ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he
seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am
afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how
he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my
throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and
master,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.
That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help
him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He
certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is
best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,
help to unnerve a man."" The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand
on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way: -  -"
345,16,5,"""Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad
and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to
hope for, except the pity of the good God?"" Lord Godalming had slipped
away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver
whistle, as he remarked: -  -"
345,16,6,"""That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on
call."" Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care
to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone
out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out
a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four
little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke: -  -"
345,16,7,"""My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of
many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the
strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are
of the common kind -  - and therefore breakable or crushable -  - his are not
amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong
in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him
as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his
touch. Keep this near your heart"" -  - as he spoke he lifted a little silver
crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him -  - ""put these
flowers round your neck"" -  - here he handed to me a wreath of withered
garlic blossoms -  - ""for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this
knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can
fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,
which we must not desecrate needless."" This was a portion of Sacred
Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others
was similarly equipped. ""Now,"" he said, ""friend John, where are the
skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house
by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's."""
345,16,8,"Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a
surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after
a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty
clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and
it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in
Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that
the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they
shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped
into the open door."
345,16,9,"""_In manus tuas, Domine!_"" he said, crossing himself as he passed over
the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The
Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it
from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our
lamps and proceeded on our search."
345,16,10,"The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so
powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible
experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,
for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every
sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing."
345,16,11,"The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches
deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down
my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The
walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of
spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the
hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time - yellowed label on each. They
had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents
in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor
lifted them. He turned to me and said: -  -"
345,16,12,"""You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know
it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?"" I had an
idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to
get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings
found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.
""This is the spot,"" said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small
map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence
regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the
bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for
as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale
through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we
encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close
quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of
his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in
a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and
close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was
an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler
air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not
alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the
pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had
become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath
exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and
intensified its loathsomeness."
345,16,13,"Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our
enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and
terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose
above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking
consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our
work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses."
345,16,14,"We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we
began: -  -"
345,16,15,"""The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then
examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some
clue as to what has become of the rest."" A glance was sufficient to show
how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was
no mistaking them."
345,16,16,"There were only twenty - nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,
for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted
door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my
heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to
see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the
red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,
as Lord Godalming said, ""I thought I saw a face, but it was only the
shadows,"" and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,
and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there
were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid
walls of the passage, there could be no hiding - place even for _him_. I
took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing."
345,16,17,"A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which
he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for
undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass
of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew
back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats."
345,16,18,"For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was
seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great
iron - bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,
and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the
huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver
whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered
from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a
minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.
Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I
noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been
taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had
elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to
swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their
moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look
like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the
threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting
their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were
multiplying in thousands, and we moved out."
345,16,19,"Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him
on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to
recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before
him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other
dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
ere the whole mass had vanished."
345,16,20,"With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.
Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves
in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to
slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something
of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our
resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and
bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found
nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all
untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.
Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when
we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been
rabbit - hunting in a summer wood."
345,16,21,"The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall - door from the bunch, and
locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
when he had done."
345,16,22,"""So far,"" he said, ""our night has been eminently successful. No harm has
come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how
many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our
first -  - and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous -  - step has been
accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or
troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have
learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute
beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable
to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and
to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell - mell
from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters
before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster -  - he has not used
his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to - night.
So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity
to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the
stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,
and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be
ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;
but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink."""
345,16,23,"The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound
from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,
after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain."
345,16,24,"I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so
softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than
usual. I hope the meeting to - night has not upset her. I am truly
thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not
think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is
settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet
to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she
suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a
sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all
is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I
daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such
confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to - morrow I shall keep
dark over to - night's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that
has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her."
345,16,25,*       *       *       *       *
345,16,26,"_1 October, later._ -  - I suppose it was natural that we should have all
overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no
rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept
till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or
three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a
few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of
blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She
complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the
day. We now know of twenty - one boxes having been removed, and if it be
that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace
them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the
sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas
Snelling to - day."
345,16,27,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,16,28,"_1 October._ -  - It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor
walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the
brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the
night he suddenly said: -  -"
345,16,29,"""Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him
this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may
be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,
and reason so sound."" I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him
that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to
keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary
instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against
getting any false impression from my patient. ""But,"" he answered, ""I
want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live
things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that
he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?"""
345,16,30,"""Excuse me,"" I said, ""but the answer is here."" I laid my hand on the
type - written matter. ""When our sane and learned lunatic made that very
statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually
nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.
Harker entered the room."" Van Helsing smiled in turn. ""Good!"" he said.
""Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it
is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the
folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.
Who knows?"" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in
hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
Van Helsing back in the study. ""Do I interrupt?"" he asked politely as he
stood at the door."
345,16,31,"""Not at all,"" I answered. ""Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.
I can go with you now, if you like."
345,16,32,"""It is needless; I have seen him!"""
345,16,33,"""Well?"""
345,16,34,"""I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.
When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with
his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a
measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. ""Don't
you know me?"" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: ""I know you well
enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself
and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick - headed
Dutchmen!"" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable
sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at
all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so
clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few
happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does
rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be
worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it
is better so."""
345,16,35,"""I agree with you with all my heart,"" I answered earnestly, for I did
not want him to weaken in this matter. ""Mrs. Harker is better out of it.
Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,
and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
infallibly have wrecked her."""
345,16,36,"So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey
and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth - boxes. I
shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to - night."
345,16,37,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,16,38,"_1 October._ -  - It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to - day;
after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him
manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This
morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went
out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of
what had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet he must
have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it
must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that
it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and
I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am
crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great
love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men."
345,16,39,"That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and
lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept
anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has
feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my
heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
low - spirited to - day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
excitement."
345,16,40,"Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I
kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to
see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate
pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does
seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which
is most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear
Lucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard
till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day - time with me she
wouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at
night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.
Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what
has come over me to - day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew
that I had been crying twice in one morning -  - I, who never cried on my
own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear -  - the dear
fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do
feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons
that we poor women have to learn...."
345,16,41,"I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing
the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying
on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere
under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so
profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.
All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight
seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be
stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin
streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness
across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a
vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must
have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy
creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out
and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now
close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the
wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was
more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,
I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the
attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into
bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have
fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the
morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a
little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was
bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of
the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams."
345,16,42,"I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I
was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my
hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn
upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the
clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,
came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently
grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I
had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to
make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my
limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed
my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what
tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The
mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I
could see it like smoke -  - or with the white energy of boiling
water -  - pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of
the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became
concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things
began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now
whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words ""a
pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night."" Was it indeed some such
spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was
composed of both the day and the night - guiding, for the fire was in the
red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I
looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like
two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering
when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's
Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan
had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist
in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became
black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to
show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be
careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were
too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe
something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm
them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their
fears for me. To - night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do
not, I shall to - morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that
cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last
night tired me more than if I had not slept at all."
345,16,43,*       *       *       *       *
345,16,44,"_2 October 10 p. m._ -  - Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have
slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the
sleep has not refreshed me, for to - day I feel terribly weak and
spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was
very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless
me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This
is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be
miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till
dinner - time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten
them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how
tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke
together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other
of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan's
manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so
sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to
give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night
before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to
me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I
have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope
I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear
comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the
power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good - night."
345,17,0,JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL
345,17,1,"_1 October, evening._ -  - I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal
Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The
very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had
proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I
learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he
was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the
responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph
Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a
saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable
type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all
about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's - eared
notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
half - obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There
were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at
197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he
deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to
scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were
chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more
fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that
he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now
fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern
shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to
be left out of his diabolical scheme -  - let alone the City itself and the
very heart of fashionable London in the south - west and west. I went back
to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had
been taken from Carfax."
345,17,2,He replied: -  -
345,17,3,"""Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some"" -  - I had given him half a
sovereign -  - ""an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of
Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley,
as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at
Purfect. There ain't a - many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'
that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut."" I asked if he could tell me
where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it
would be worth another half - sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest
of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search
then and there. At the door he stopped, and said: -  -"
345,17,4,"""Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a - keepin' you 'ere. I
may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way
to tell ye much to - night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.
If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on
it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to - night. But
ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch
'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore."""
345,17,5,"This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to
buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she
came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had
again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way
to home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to - night, and want sleep.
Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as
though she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be
kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the
others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and
worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors
were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence
must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any
circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she
herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the
Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision."
345,17,6,*       *       *       *       *
345,17,7,"_2 October, evening._ -  - A long and trying and exciting day. By the first
post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on
which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand: -  -"
345,17,8,"""Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for
the depite."""
345,17,9,"I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy
and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,
but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for
her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,
with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and
in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I
was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should
have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some
difficulty, Potter's Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked
for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had found
the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging - house.
When I asked the man who came to the door for the ""depite,"" he shook his
head, and said: ""I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never
'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody
of that kind livin' ere or anywheres."" I took out Smollet's letter, and
as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name
of the court might guide me. ""What are you?"" I asked."
345,17,10,"""I'm the depity,"" he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right
track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half - crown tip put the
deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who
had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at
Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that
morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but
he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a ""new - fangled ware'us"";
and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve
o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this
I got at a coffee - shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One
of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a
new ""cold storage"" building; and as this suited the condition of a
""new - fangled ware'us,"" I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly
gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the
coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my
suggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for
the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was
a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had
promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me
that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,
and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes -  - ""main
heavy ones"" -  - with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I
asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to
which he replied: -  -"
345,17,11,"""Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a
big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a
dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse we
tooked the bloomin' boxes from."""
345,17,12,"""How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?"""
345,17,13,"""There was the old party what engaged me a - waitin' in the 'ouse at
Purfleet. He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse
me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller,
with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw
a shadder."""
345,17,14,How this phrase thrilled through me!
345,17,15,"""Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and
me a - puffin' an' a - blowin' afore I could up - end mine anyhow -  - an' I'm no
chicken, neither."""
345,17,16,"""How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?"" I asked."
345,17,17,"""He was there too. He must 'a' started off and got there afore me, for
when I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped me
to carry the boxes into the 'all."""
345,17,18,"""The whole nine?"" I asked."
345,17,19,"""Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second. It was
main dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome."" I
interrupted him: -  -"
345,17,20,"""Were the boxes left in the hall?"""
345,17,21,"""Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it."" I made one
more attempt to further matters: -  -"
345,17,22,"""You didn't have any key?"""
345,17,23,"""Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door 'isself
an' shut it again when I druv off. I don't remember the last time -  - but
that was the beer."""
345,17,24,"""And you can't remember the number of the house?"""
345,17,25,"""No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un
with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. I
know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an'
they seein' they got so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of them
by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot
of them went away cussin'."" I thought that with this description I could
find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started
off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count
could, it was evident, handle the earth - boxes himself. If so, time was
precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of
distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task
unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked
westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house
described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs
arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long
untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were
up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been
a large notice - board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,
whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have
been able to see the notice - board intact, as it would, perhaps, have
given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my
experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not
but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means
discovered of gaining access to the house."
345,17,26,"There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and
nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything
could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the
Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the
grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything
about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been
taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to
very lately there had been a notice - board of ""For Sale"" up, and that
perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me
something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on
the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know
or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled
away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I
did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &
Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in
Sackville Street."
345,17,27,"The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but
uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the
Piccadilly house -  - which throughout our interview he called a
""mansion"" -  - was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I
asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and
paused a few seconds before replying: -  -"
345,17,28,"""It is sold, sir."""
345,17,29,"""Pardon me,"" I said, with equal politeness, ""but I have a special reason
for wishing to know who purchased it."""
345,17,30,"Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. ""It is sold,
sir,"" was again his laconic reply."
345,17,31,"""Surely,"" I said, ""you do not mind letting me know so much."""
345,17,32,"""But I do mind,"" he answered. ""The affairs of their clients are
absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy."" This was
manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with
him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said: -  -"
345,17,33,"""Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their
confidence. I am myself a professional man."" Here I handed him my card.
""In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of
Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,
he understood, lately for sale."" These words put a different complexion
on affairs. He said: -  -"
345,17,34,"""I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would
I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of
renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur
Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult
the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
lordship by to - night's post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far
deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his
lordship."""
345,17,35,"I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,
gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away. It was now dark, and I
was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company
and came down to Purfleet by the next train."
345,17,36,"I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she
made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to
think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her
inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at
our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or
else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when
any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we
made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing
knowledge would be torture to her."
345,17,37,"I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone;
so after dinner -  - followed by a little music to save appearances even
amongst ourselves -  - I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me
as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I
came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no
difference between us."
345,17,38,"When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in
the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read
it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own
information; when I had finished Van Helsing said: -  -"
345,17,39,"""This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on
the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then
our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search
until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the
wretch to his real death."" We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.
Morris spoke: -  -"
345,17,40,"""Say! how are we going to get into that house?"""
345,17,41,"""We got into the other,"" answered Lord Godalming quickly."
345,17,42,"""But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night
and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to
commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don't
see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key
of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the
morning."" Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked
about the room. By - and - by he stopped and said, turning from one to
another of us: -  -"
345,17,43,"""Quincey's head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we
got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand -  - unless we
can find the Count's key basket."""
345,17,44,"As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at
least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's,
we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good
while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and
bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the
moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed...."
345,17,45,"Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her
forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even
in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she
did this morning. To - morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be
herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!"
345,17,46,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,17,47,"_1 October._ -  - I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so
rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they
always mean something more than his own well - being, they form a more
than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his
repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
He was, in fact, commanding destiny -  - subjectively. He did not really
care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and
looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I
thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked
him: -  -"
345,17,48,"""What about the flies these times?"" He smiled on me in quite a superior
sort of way -  - such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio -  - as
he answered me: -  -"
345,17,49,"""The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well
when they typified the soul as a butterfly!"""
345,17,50,"I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said
quickly: -  -"
345,17,51,"""Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?"" His madness foiled his
reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said: -  -"
345,17,52,"""Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want."" Here he brightened
up; ""I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I
have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to
study zoöphagy!"""
345,17,53,"This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on: -  -"
345,17,54,"""Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?"" He smiled with an
ineffably benign superiority."
345,17,55,"""Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the
Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I
may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things
purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied
spiritually!"" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall
Enoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt
that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic: -  -"
345,17,56,"""And why with Enoch?"""
345,17,57,"""Because he walked with God."" I could not see the analogy, but did not
like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied: -  -"
345,17,58,"""So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?"" I put
my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.
The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his
old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as
he replied: -  -"
345,17,59,"""I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them if
I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't eat them
or -  -  -  - "" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his
face, like a wind - sweep on the surface of the water. ""And doctor, as to
life, what is it after all? When you've got all you require, and you
know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends -  - good
friends -  - like you, Dr. Seward""; this was said with a leer of
inexpressible cunning. ""I know that I shall never lack the means of
life!"""
345,17,60,"I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some
antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as
he -  - a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it
was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away."
345,17,61,"Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come
without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him
that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything
to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are
Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the
record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate
knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish
to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with
me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he
might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield
might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were
alone."
345,17,62,"I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose
which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I
came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his
lips: -  -"
345,17,63,"""What about souls?"" It was evident then that my surmise had been
correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. ""What about them
yourself?"" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round
him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for
an answer."
345,17,64,"""I don't want any souls!"" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The
matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it -  - to ""be
cruel only to be kind."" So I said: -  -"
345,17,65,"""You like life, and you want life?"""
345,17,66,"""Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn't worry about that!"""
345,17,67,"""But,"" I asked, ""how are we to get the life without getting the soul
also?"" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up: -  -"
345,17,68,"""A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with
the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing
and twittering and miauing all round you. You've got their lives, you
know, and you must put up with their souls!"" Something seemed to affect
his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,
screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being
soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave
me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child -  - only a child,
though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It
was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,
and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign
to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and
go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,
speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears: -  -"
345,17,69,"""Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?"" He seemed to
wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied: -  -"
345,17,70,"""Not much! flies are poor things, after all!"" After a pause he added,
""But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same."""
345,17,71,"""Or spiders?"" I went on."
345,17,72,"""Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in them
to eat or"" -  - he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden
topic."
345,17,73,"""So, so!"" I thought to myself, ""this is the second time he has suddenly
stopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean?"" Renfield seemed himself
aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract
my attention from it: -  -"
345,17,74,"""I don't take any stock at all in such matters. 'Rats and mice and such
small deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken - feed of the larder' they
might be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well
ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop - sticks, as to try to
interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before
me."""
345,17,75,"""I see,"" I said. ""You want big things that you can make your teeth meet
in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?"""
345,17,76,"""What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!"" He was getting too wide
awake, so I thought I would press him hard. ""I wonder,"" I said
reflectively, ""what an elephant's soul is like!"""
345,17,77,"The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his
high - horse and became a child again."
345,17,78,"""I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!"" he said. For a
few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with
his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. ""To
hell with you and your souls!"" he shouted. ""Why do you plague me about
souls? Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,
without thinking of souls!"" He looked so hostile that I thought he was
in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,
however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically: -  -"
345,17,79,"""Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so
worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the
problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and
tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait - waistcoat. I
want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am
sure you will understand!"" He had evidently self - control; so when the
attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield
watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable
dignity and sweetness: -  -"
345,17,80,"""Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that
I am very, very grateful to you!"" I thought it well to leave him in this
mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in
this man's state. Several points seem to make what the American
interviewer calls ""a story,"" if one could only get them in proper order.
Here they are: -  -"
345,17,81,"Will not mention ""drinking."""
345,17,82,"Fears the thought of being burdened with the ""soul"" of anything."
345,17,83,"Has no dread of wanting ""life"" in the future."
345,17,84,"Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being
haunted by their souls."
345,17,85,"Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind
that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence -  - the
burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!"
345,17,86,And the assurance -  - ?
345,17,87,"Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of
terror afoot!"
345,17,88,*       *       *       *       *
345,17,89,"_Later._ -  - I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my
suspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a
while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door
we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time
which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that
he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the
autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk
of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He
went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had
got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note - book. We had to come
away as ignorant as we went in."
345,17,90,His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to - night.
345,17,91,"_Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming._"
345,17,92,"_""1 October._"
345,17,93,"""My Lord,"
345,17,94,"""We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with
regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your
behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and
purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors
of the late Mr. Archibald Winter - Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign
nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the
purchase money in notes 'over the counter,' if your Lordship will pardon
us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever
of him."

345,17,96,"""Your Lordship's humble servants,"
345,17,97,"""MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY."""
345,17,98,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,17,99,"_2 October._ -  - I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to
make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room,
and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he
was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire
in the study -  - Mrs. Harker having gone to bed -  - we discussed the attempts
and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,
and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one."
345,17,100,"Before going to bed I went round to the patient's room and looked in
through the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart
rose and fell with regular respiration."
345,17,101,"This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight
he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him
if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was
something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if
he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having ""dozed"" for
a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are
watched."
345,17,102,"To - day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are
looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have
horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we
seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported
earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his
weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the
British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old
physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,
and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be
useful to us later."
345,17,103,"I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in
strait - waistcoats."
345,17,104,*       *       *       *       *
345,17,105,"_Later._ -  - We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our
work of to - morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if
Renfield's quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so
followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the
monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get
some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument
with him to - day and his resumption of fly - catching, it might afford us a
valuable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he? -  -  -  -  That
wild yell seemed to come from his room...."
345,17,106,*       *       *       *       *
345,17,107,"The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had
somehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went
to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.
I must go at once...."
345,18,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
345,18,1,"_3 October._ -  - Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well
as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I
can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed."
345,18,2,"When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his
left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it
became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;
there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body
which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see
that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the
floor -  - indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood
originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as
we turned him over: -  -"
345,18,3,"""I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and
the whole side of his face are paralysed."" How such a thing could have
happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite
bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said: -  -"
345,18,4,"""I can't understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by
beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the
Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he
might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward
kink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things
occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if his
face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of
it."" I said to him: -  -"
345,18,5,"""Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want
him without an instant's delay."" The man ran off, and within a few
minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When
he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and
then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he
said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant: -  -"
345,18,6,"""Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much
attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.
If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you."""
345,18,7,"The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that
he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with
extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had
evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he
looked at the patient, he whispered to me: -  -"
345,18,8,"""Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes
conscious, after the operation."" So I said: -  -"
345,18,9,"""I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at
present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.
Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere."""
345,18,10,"The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.
The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed
fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The
Professor thought a moment and said: -  -"
345,18,11,"""We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far
as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of
his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the
brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be
too late."" As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I
went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and
Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke: -  -"
345,18,12,"""I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.
So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things
are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us
these times. I've been thinking that to - morrow night will not see things
as they have been. We'll have to look back -  - and forward a little more
than we have done. May we come in?"" I nodded, and held the door open
till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the
attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the
floor, he said softly: -  -"
345,18,13,"""My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!"" I told him
briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after
the operation -  - for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat
down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched
in patience."
345,18,14,"""We shall wait,"" said Van Helsing, ""just long enough to fix the best
spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove
the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing."""
345,18,15,"The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a
horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered
that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded
the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;
but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men
who have heard the death - watch. The poor man's breathing came in
uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes
and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he
would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick
beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost
hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my
temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became
agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from
their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal
torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead
some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect
it."
345,18,16,"At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was
sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor
and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he
spoke: -  -"
345,18,17,"""There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have
been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!
We shall operate just above the ear."""
345,18,18,"Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the
breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so
prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.
Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.
This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad
surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved
convulsively, and as he did so, said: -  -"
345,18,19,"""I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait - waistcoat. I
have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot
move. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts
dreadfully."" He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his
eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van
Helsing said in a quiet grave tone: -  -"
345,18,20,"""Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield."" As he heard the voice his face
brightened, through its mutilation, and he said: -  -"
345,18,21,"""That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some
water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed"" -  - he
stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey -  - ""The
brandy -  - it is in my study -  - quick!"" He flew and returned with a glass,
the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched
lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor
injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite
conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I
shall never forget, and said: -  -"
345,18,22,"""I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.""
Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two
figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on: -  -"
345,18,23,"""If I were not sure already, I would know from them."" For an instant his
eyes closed -  - not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were
bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,
hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed: -  -"
345,18,24,"""Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;
and then I must go back to death -  - or worse! Wet my lips with brandy
again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor
crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left
me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for I
felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as
I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left
me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain
seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the
dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!"" As he spoke, Van
Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and
gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly
and said: ""Go on,"" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded: -  -"
345,18,25,"""He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;
but he was solid then -  - not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a
man's when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white
teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt
of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn't ask him to come in
at first, though I knew he wanted to -  - just as he had wanted all along.
Then he began promising me things -  - not in words but by doing them."" He
was interrupted by a word from the Professor: -  -"
345,18,26,"""How?"""
345,18,27,"""By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the
sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their
wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross - bones on their
backs."" Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously: -  -"
345,18,28,"""The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_ -  - what you call the
'Death's - head Moth'?"" The patient went on without stopping."
345,18,29,"""Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,
millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats
too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely
buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.
Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He
beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his
hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass
spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and
then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there
were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red -  - like His, only
smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he
seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more
and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship
me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close
over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening
the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were
all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only
open an inch wide -  - just as the Moon herself has often come in through
the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and
splendour."""
345,18,30,"His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and
he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in
the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him
back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: ""Let him go on. Do
not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all
if once he lost the thread of his thought."" He proceeded: -  -"
345,18,31,"""All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not
even a blow - fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.
When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even
knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked
out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he
owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn't even smell the same
as he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.
Harker had come into the room."""
345,18,32,"The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind
him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.
They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,
however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without
noticing: -  -"
345,18,33,"""When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;
it was like tea after the teapot had been watered."" Here we all moved,
but no one said a word; he went on: -  -"
345,18,34,"""I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look the
same. I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood
in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it
at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad
to know that He had been taking the life out of her."" I could feel that
the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. ""So when
He came to - night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I
grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and
as I knew I was a madman -  - at times anyhow -  - I resolved to use my power.
Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle
with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't
mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned
into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and
when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There
was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed
to steal away under the door."" His voice was becoming fainter and his
breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively."
345,18,35,"""We know the worst now,"" he said. ""He is here, and we know his purpose.
It may not be too late. Let us be armed -  - the same as we were the other
night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare."" There was no
need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words -  - we shared them in
common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we
had when we entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, and
as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said: -  -"
345,18,36,"""They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is
over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.
Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!"" He stopped; his
voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in
my own heart."
345,18,37,"Outside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the
latter said: -  -"
345,18,38,"""Should we disturb her?"""
345,18,39,"""We must,"" said Van Helsing grimly. ""If the door be locked, I shall
break it in."""
345,18,40,"""May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady's
room!"""
345,18,41,"Van Helsing said solemnly, ""You are always right; but this is life and
death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they
are all as one to me to - night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if
the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you
too, my friends. Now!"""
345,18,42,"He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw
ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell
headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw
across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw
appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,
and my heart seemed to stand still."
345,18,43,"The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room
was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan
Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.
Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white - clad
figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.
His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised
the Count -  - in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left
hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms
at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,
forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared
with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which
was shown by his torn - open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible
resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to
compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his
face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap
into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils
of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the
white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood - dripping mouth,
champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw
his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned
and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,
and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred
Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside
the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,
lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a
great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up
under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we
looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting
open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved
forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with
it had given a scream so wild, so ear - piercing, so despairing that it
seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a
few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was
ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared
her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of
blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her
poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the
Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail
which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an
endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently
over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant
despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me: -  -"
345,18,44,"""Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can
do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers
herself; I must wake him!"" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water
and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while
holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was
heart - breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the
window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey
Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great
yew - tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the
instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial
consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well
be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and
then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he
started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to
him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,
however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held
her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook."
345,18,45,"""In God's name what does this mean?"" Harker cried out. ""Dr. Seward, Dr.
Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,
what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to
this!"" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly
together. ""Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!"" With a quick
movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes, -  - all the
man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. ""What has happened?
Tell me all about it!"" he cried without pausing. ""Dr. Van Helsing, you
love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too
far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!"" His wife, through her terror
and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly
forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out: -  -"
345,18,46,"""No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough
to - night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay
with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!"" Her
expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she
pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely."
345,18,47,"Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his
little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness: -  -"
345,18,48,"""Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no
foul thing can approach. You are safe for to - night; and we must be calm
and take counsel together."" She shuddered and was silent, holding down
her head on her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white
night - robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where
the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she
saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking
sobs: -  -"
345,18,49,"""Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it
should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have
most cause to fear."" To this he spoke out resolutely: -  -"
345,18,50,"""Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not
hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my
deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,
if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!"" He put out
his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there
sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked
damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a
while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to
me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous
power to the utmost: -  -"
345,18,51,"""And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad
fact; tell me all that has been."" I told him exactly what had happened,
and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched
and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had
held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to
the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to
see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over
the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled
hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.
They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me
questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of
their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband
and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence
to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming
answered: -  -"
345,18,52,"""I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I
looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,
however -  -  -  - "" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on
the bed. Van Helsing said gravely: -  -"
345,18,53,"""Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now
is in knowing all. Tell freely!"" So Art went on: -  -"
345,18,54,"""He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few
seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been
burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the
cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax
had helped the flames."" Here I interrupted. ""Thank God there is the
other copy in the safe!"" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he
went on: ""I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked
into Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except -  -  -  - !"" Again he
paused. ""Go on,"" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and
moistening his lips with his tongue, added: ""except that the poor fellow
is dead."" Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of
us she said solemnly: -  -"
345,18,55,"""God's will be done!"" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back
something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.
Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked: -  -"
345,18,56,"""And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?"""
345,18,57,"""A little,"" he answered. ""It may be much eventually, but at present I
can't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would
go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from
Renfield's window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some
shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He
will not be back to - night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the
dawn is close. We must work to - morrow!"""
345,18,58,"He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps
a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could
hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his
hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head: -  -"
345,18,59,"""And now, Madam Mina -  - poor, dear, dear Madam Mina -  - tell us exactly what
happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is
need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done
quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must
end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and
learn."""
345,18,60,"The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves
as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and
lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held
out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and
kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that
of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.
After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she
began: -  -"
345,18,61,"""I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a
long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads
of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind -  - all of them
connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.""
Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said
lovingly: ""Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me
through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me
to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I
need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work
with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to
sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no
more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when
next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I
had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find
it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague
terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.
I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it
seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I
tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I
looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside
the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist -  - or rather as if the mist
had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared -  - stood a
tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of
the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light
fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white
teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the
sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the
red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant
my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was
paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,
pointing as he spoke to Jonathan: -  -"
345,18,62,"""'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out
before your very eyes.' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or
say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder
and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did
so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well
be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have
appeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not
want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that
such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity
me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!"" Her husband groaned
again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if
he were the injured one, and went on: -  -"
345,18,63,"""I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long
this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time
must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I
saw it drip with the fresh blood!"" The remembrance seemed for a while to
overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her
husband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and
went on: -  -"
345,18,64,"""Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play
your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and
frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,
and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They
should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they
played wits against me -  - against me who commanded nations, and intrigued
for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were
born -  - I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now
to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful
wine - press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my
helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall
minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you
have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my
call. When my brain says ""Come!"" to you, you shall cross land or sea to
do my bidding; and to that end this!' With that he pulled open his
shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When
the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding
them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to
the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the -  -  -  -  Oh
my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a
fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my
days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;
and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!"" Then she began to rub her
lips as though to cleanse them from pollution."
345,18,65,"As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,
and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;
but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look
which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first
red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out
against the whitening hair."
345,18,66,"We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy
pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action."
345,18,67,"Of this I am sure: the sun rises to - day on no more miserable house in
all the great round of its daily course."
345,19,0,JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL
345,19,1,"_3 October._ -  - As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It
is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and
take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed
that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God
knows, required to - day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare
not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end
the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could
not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to - day. However,
we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears
running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our
faith is tested -  - that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us
up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!"
345,19,2,"When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor
Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward
told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below
they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was
all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken."
345,19,3,"Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had
heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down -  - he confessed to
half dozing -  - when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield
had called out loudly several times, ""God! God! God!"" after that there
was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying
on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing
asked if he had heard ""voices"" or ""a voice,"" and he said he could not
say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as
there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear
to it, if required, that the word ""God"" was spoken by the patient. Dr.
Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into
the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it
would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As
it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a
certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the
coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily
to the same result."
345,19,4,"When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next
step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full
confidence; that nothing of any sort -  - no matter how painful -  - should be
kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful
to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of
despair. ""There must be no concealment,"" she said, ""Alas! we have had
too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can
give me more pain than I have already endured -  - than I suffer now!
Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!""
Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly
but quietly: -  -"
345,19,5,"""But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for
others from yourself, after what has happened?"" Her face grew set in its
lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she
answered: -  -"
345,19,6,"""Ah no! for my mind is made up!"""
345,19,7,"""To what?"" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in
our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer
came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact: -  -"
345,19,8,"""Because if I find in myself -  - and I shall watch keenly for it -  - a sign of
harm to any that I love, I shall die!"""
345,19,9,"""You would not kill yourself?"" he asked, hoarsely."
345,19,10,"""I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a
pain, and so desperate an effort!"" She looked at him meaningly as she
spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and
put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:"
345,19,11,"""My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I
could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,
even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my
child -  -  -  - "" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his
throat; he gulped it down and went on: -  -"
345,19,12,"""There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not
die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until
the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not
die; for if he is still with the quick Un - Dead, your death would make
you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to
live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death
himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the
night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you
do not die -  - nay, nor think of death -  - till this great evil be past."" The
poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a
quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all
silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to
him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand: -  -"
345,19,13,"""I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall
strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may
have passed away from me."" She was so good and brave that we all felt
that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we
began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all
the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we
might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.
She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do -  - if ""pleased"" could
be used in connection with so grim an interest."
345,19,14,"As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was
prepared with an exact ordering of our work."
345,19,15,"""It is perhaps well,"" he said, ""that at our meeting after our visit to
Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth - boxes that lay
there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and
would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an
effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our
intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a
power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use
them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as
to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in
Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To - day, then, is ours;
and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning
guards us in its course. Until it sets to - night, that monster must
retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations
of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear
through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he
must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out
all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch
him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching
and the destroying shall be, in time, sure."" Here I started up for I
could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so
preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us,
since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up
his hand warningly. ""Nay, friend Jonathan,"" he said, ""in this, the
quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all
act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in
all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.
The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have
deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he
write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings
that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,
where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the
very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and
search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our
friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we
run down our old fox -  - so? is it not?"""
345,19,16,"""Then let us come at once,"" I cried, ""we are wasting the precious,
precious time!"" The Professor did not move, but simply said: -  -"
345,19,17,"""And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?"""
345,19,18,"""Any way!"" I cried. ""We shall break in if need be."""
345,19,19,"""And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?"""
345,19,20,"I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good
reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could: -  -"
345,19,21,"""Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am
in."""
345,19,22,"""Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to
your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at
movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it
seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get
into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?"" I nodded."
345,19,23,"""Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could
not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the
housebreaker, what would you do?"""
345,19,24,"""I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the
lock for me."""
345,19,25,"""And your police, they would interfere, would they not?"""
345,19,26,"""Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed."""
345,19,27,"""Then,"" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, ""all that is in doubt is
the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to
whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your
police must indeed be zealous men and clever -  - oh, so clever! -  - in reading
the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my
friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this
your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such
things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,
no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine
house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland
and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and
got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out
and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he
have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;
and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of
that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him
that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away
within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all
they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland
he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done
_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not go
so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem
it strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many
about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the
house."""
345,19,28,"I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina's
face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van
Helsing went on: -  -"
345,19,29,"""When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of
us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be
more earth - boxes -  - at Bermondsey and Mile End."""
345,19,30,"Lord Godalming stood up. ""I can be of some use here,"" he said. ""I shall
wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most
convenient."""
345,19,31,"""Look here, old fellow,"" said Morris, ""it is a capital idea to have all
ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don't you think that one
of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of
Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?
It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and
even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to."""
345,19,32,"""Friend Quincey is right!"" said the Professor. ""His head is what you
call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to
do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may."""
345,19,33,"Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see
that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the
terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale -  - almost
ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in
somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give
her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of
what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As
yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet
was short, and there was time for fear."
345,19,34,"When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the
disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was
finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the
Count's lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we
should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his
presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us
some new clue."
345,19,35,"As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,
after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;
that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming
and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.
It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count
might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be
able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to
follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as
my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect
Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would
not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter
in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count's papers might be
some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;
and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to
cope with the Count's extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina's
resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that
we should all work together. ""As for me,"" she said, ""I have no fear.
Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must
have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if
He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present."" So I
started up crying out: ""Then in God's name let us come at once, for we
are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we
think."""
345,19,36,"""Not so!"" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand."
345,19,37,"""But why?"" I asked."
345,19,38,"""Do you forget,"" he said, with actually a smile, ""that last night he
banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?"""
345,19,39,"Did I forget! shall I ever -  - can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that
terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but
the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and
shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her
frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in
the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,
he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. ""Oh,
Madam Mina,"" he said, ""dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so
reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old
lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will
forget it, will you not?"" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took
his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely: -  -"
345,19,40,"""No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I
have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all
together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we
must all eat that we may be strong."""
345,19,41,"Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and
encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of
us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said: -  -"
345,19,42,"""Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we
all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's
lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?"" We all assured
him. ""Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe
here until the sunset; and before then we shall return -  - if -  -  -  -  We shall
return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I
have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing
of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard
yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the
name of the Father, the Son, and -  -  -  - """
345,19,43,"There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he
had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it -  - had burned
into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white - hot metal. My poor
darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as
her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that
her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the
words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased
to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her
knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair
over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out: -  -"
345,19,44,"""Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must
bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day."" They
all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless
grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our
sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away
their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said
gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some
way inspired, and was stating things outside himself: -  -"
345,19,45,"""It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,
as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of
the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam
Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that
red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,
and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as
we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the
burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did
in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of
His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other
through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and
fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man."""
345,19,46,"There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.
Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old
man's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all
knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each
other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the
head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help
and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us."
345,19,47,"It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which
neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out."
345,19,48,"To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a
vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible
land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant
many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so
the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks."
345,19,49,"We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on
the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic
surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such
fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there
not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded
with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and
in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.
Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them: -  -"
345,19,50,"""And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this
earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far
distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has
been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more
holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to
God."" As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and
very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled
musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention
was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the
Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down
the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked."
345,19,51,"One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left
them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion
of the Host."
345,19,52,"When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly: -  -"
345,19,53,"""So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can
be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam
Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!"""
345,19,54,"As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our
train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the
window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to
tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in
reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her
hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station
and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the
platform."
345,19,55,I have written this in the train.
345,19,56,*       *       *       *       *
345,19,57,"_Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock._ -  - Just before we reached Fenchurch Street
Lord Godalming said to me: -  -"
345,19,58,"""Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in
case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it
wouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a
solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you
should have known better."" I demurred as to my not sharing any danger
even of odium, but he went on: ""Besides, it will attract less attention
if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with
the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had
better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,
somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and
the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the
lookout for you, and shall let you in."""
345,19,59,"""The advice is good!"" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming
and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner
of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green
Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was
centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst
its more lively and spruce - looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench
within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little
attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we
waited for the coming of the others."
345,19,60,"At length we saw a four - wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely
fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended
a thick - set working man with his rush - woven basket of tools. Morris paid
the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two
ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.
The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes
of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered
along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down
placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a
selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly
fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and
turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and
the man lifted a good - sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he
began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling
about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the
door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others
entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van
Helsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the
workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly
open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.
This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and
gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his
coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole
transaction."
345,19,61,"When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at
the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood
Lord Godalming lighting a cigar."
345,19,62,"""The place smells so vilely,"" said the latter as we came in. It did
indeed smell vilely -  - like the old chapel at Carfax -  - and with our
previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the
place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together
in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal
with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the
house. In the dining - room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found
eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!
Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the
missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out
across a narrow stone - flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,
pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no
windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over - looked. We did not
lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had
brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had
treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the
Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for
any of his effects."
345,19,63,"After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,
we came to the conclusion that the dining - room contained any effects
which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine
them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining - room
table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;
deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;
note - paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin
wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes
brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin -  - the latter containing
dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a
little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to
the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming
and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the
houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great
bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us
are, with what patience we can, waiting their return -  - or the coming of
the Count."
345,20,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
345,20,1,"_3 October._ -  - The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for
the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep
our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent
purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.
The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.
Last night he was a frank, happy - looking man, with strong, youthful
face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To - day he is a drawn,
haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning
eyes and grief - written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in
fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if
all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,
in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I
thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his -  -  -  - ! The Professor knows
this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he
has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So
well as I can remember, here it is: -  -"
345,20,2,"""I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all
the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the
greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there
are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of
it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda - Pesth,
he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and
alchemist -  - which latter was the highest development of the
science - knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond
compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to
attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time
that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the
physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is
growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of
man's stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not
been that we have crossed his path he would be yet -  - he may be yet if we
fail -  - the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must
lead through Death, not Life."""
345,20,3,"Harker groaned and said, ""And this is all arrayed against my darling!
But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!"""
345,20,4,"""He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but
surely; that big child - brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as
yet, a child - brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain
things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means
to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait
and to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto."""
345,20,5,"""I fail to understand,"" said Harker wearily. ""Oh, do be more plain to
me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain."""
345,20,6,The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke: -  -
345,20,7,"""Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this
monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been
making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend
John's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when
and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by
an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not
see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He
knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great
child - brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he
might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he
found that this be all - right, he try to move them all alone. And so he
progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where
they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So
that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his
form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his
hiding - place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him
just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;
and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he
can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is
there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even
more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be
well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To - day is our
day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are
five of us when those absent ones return."""
345,20,8,"Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the
double postman's knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the
hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to
keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a
despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the
direction, opened it and read aloud."
345,20,9,"""Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and
hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want
to see you: Mina."""
345,20,10,"There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice: -  -"
345,20,11,"""Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!"" Van Helsing turned to him
quickly and said: -  -"
345,20,12,"""God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice
as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings."""
345,20,13,"""I care for nothing now,"" he answered hotly, ""except to wipe out this
brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!"""
345,20,14,"""Oh, hush, hush, my child!"" said Van Helsing. ""God does not purchase
souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep
faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your
devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be
doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are
all devoted to this cause, and to - day shall see the end. The time is
coming for action; to - day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,
and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive
here -  - see, it is twenty minutes past one -  - and there are yet some times
before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for
is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first."""
345,20,15,"About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, there
came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary
knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made
the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and
together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various
armaments -  - the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van
Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood
back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts
must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we
saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed
the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the
hall: -  -"
345,20,16,"""It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we
destroyed them all!"""
345,20,17,"""Destroyed?"" asked the Professor."
345,20,18,"""For him!"" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said: -  -"
345,20,19,"""There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn't turn up
by five o'clock, we must start off; for it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker
alone after sunset."""
345,20,20,"""He will be here before long now,"" said Van Helsing, who had been
consulting his pocket - book. ""_Nota bene_, in Madam's telegram he went
south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could
only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one
o'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only
suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would
suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a
short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to
Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be
carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not
have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that
we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your
arms! Be ready!"" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could
hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door."
345,20,21,"I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a
dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and
adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always
been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been
accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be
renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once
laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a
gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were
just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could
guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.
Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to
move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the
seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along
the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise -  - at least
he feared it."
345,20,22,"Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past
us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something
so panther - like in the movement -  - something so unhuman, that it seemed
to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was
Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door
leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a
horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye - teeth long
and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of
lion - like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single
impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some
better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what
we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would
avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had
ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The
blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count's
leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne
through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,
making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank - notes and a stream of gold
fell out. The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a
moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife
aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a
protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I
felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I
saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously
by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of
hate and baffled malignity -  - of anger and hellish rage -  - which came over
the Count's face. His waxen hue became greenish - yellow by the contrast
of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the
pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous
dive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping
a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw
himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,
he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the
shivering glass I could hear the ""ting"" of the gold, as some of the
sovereigns fell on the flagging."
345,20,23,"We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up
the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.
There he turned and spoke to us: -  -"
345,20,24,"""You think to baffle me, you -  - with your pale faces all in a row, like
sheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think
you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is
just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your
girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and
others shall yet be mine -  - my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my
jackals when I want to feed. Bah!"" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed
quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he
fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us
to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following
him through the stable, we moved toward the hall."
345,20,25,"""We have learnt something -  - much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he
fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His
very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You
follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For
me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he
return."" As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took
the title - deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the
remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with
a match."
345,20,26,"Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had
lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,
bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there
was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back
of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart."
345,20,27,"It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to
recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the
Professor when he said: -  -"
345,20,28,"""Let us go back to Madam Mina -  - poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do
just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need
not despair. There is but one more earth - box, and we must try to find
it; when that is done all may yet be well."" I could see that he spoke as
bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken
down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress -  - he
was thinking of his wife."
345,20,29,"With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker
waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her
bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as
pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were
in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully: -  -"
345,20,30,"""I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!"" As she spoke,
she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it -  - ""Lay your
poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect
us if He so will it in His good intent."" The poor fellow groaned. There
was no place for words in his sublime misery."
345,20,31,"We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us
all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry
people -  - for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast -  - or the sense
of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less
miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to
our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and
although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to
threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was
manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the
part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to
her husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could
protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,
till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up
to the present time. Then without letting go her husband's hand she
stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the
scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty
of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which
she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our
teeth -  - remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against
our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and
we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and
purity and faith, was outcast from God."
345,20,32,"""Jonathan,"" she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was
so full of love and tenderness, ""Jonathan dear, and you all my true,
true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this
dreadful time. I know that you must fight -  - that you must destroy even as
you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;
but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this
misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when
he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have
spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may
not hold your hands from his destruction."""
345,20,33,"As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, as
though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.
Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his
knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she
must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing
than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing
his hand from hers as he spoke: -  -"
345,20,34,"""May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that
earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send
his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!"""
345,20,35,"""Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don't say such things,
Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just
think, my dear -  - I have been thinking all this long, long day of it -  - that
... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some
other like you -  - and with equal cause for anger -  - may deny it to me! Oh,
my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought
had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured
your wild words, except as the heart - broken wail of a very loving and
sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence
of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom
so many sorrows have come."""
345,20,36,"We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept
openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.
Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms
round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned
to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone
with their God."
345,20,37,"Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming
of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.
She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her
husband's sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,
I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at
hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.
When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should
sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the
poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us
shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,
for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go
to bed."
345,20,38,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._
345,20,39,"_3 - 4 October, close to midnight._ -  - I thought yesterday would never end.
There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief
that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must
now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step
was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one
earth - box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he
chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the
meantime! -  - the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.
This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that
one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her
sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster
seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer
by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting
reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is
sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be
like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so
calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came
over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.
I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her
face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy
myself, though I am weary -  - weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;
for there is to - morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me
until...."
345,20,40,*       *       *       *       *
345,20,41,"_Later._ -  - I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was
sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,
for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand
over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear: -  -"
345,20,42,"""Hush! there is someone in the corridor!"" I got up softly, and crossing
the room, gently opened the door."
345,20,43,"Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He
raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me: -  -"
345,20,44,"""Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all
night. We don't mean to take any chances!"""
345,20,45,"His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.
She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale
face as she put her arms round me and said softly: -  -"
345,20,46,"""Oh, thank God for good brave men!"" With a sigh she sank back again to
sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again."
345,20,47,*       *       *       *       *
345,20,48,"_4 October, morning._ -  - Once again during the night I was wakened by
Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming
dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was
like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly: -  -"
345,20,49,"""Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once."""
345,20,50,"""Why?"" I asked."
345,20,51,"""I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured
without my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I
shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close."" I
went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing
me, he sprang to his feet."
345,20,52,"""Is anything wrong?"" he asked, in alarm."
345,20,53,"""No,"" I replied; ""but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once."""
345,20,54,"""I will go,"" he said, and hurried into the Professor's room."
345,20,55,"In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his
dressing - gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at
the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile -  - a
positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he
said: -  -"
345,20,56,"""Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,
we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to - day!"" Then
turning to her, he said, cheerfully: ""And what am I do for you? For at
this hour you do not want me for nothings."""
345,20,57,"""I want you to hypnotise me!"" she said. ""Do it before the dawn, for I
feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is
short!"" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed."
345,20,58,"Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,
from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina
gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat
like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually
her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of
her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few
more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was
covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she
did not seem the same woman. There was a far - away look in her eyes, and
her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to
impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.
They came on tip - toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the
foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The
stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone
which would not break the current of her thoughts: -  -"
345,20,59,"""Where are you?"" The answer came in a neutral way: -  -"
345,20,60,"""I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own."" For several
minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood
staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room
was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van
Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed
just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse
itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again: -  -"
345,20,61,"""Where are you now?"" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it
were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the
same tone when reading her shorthand notes."
345,20,62,"""I do not know. It is all strange to me!"""
345,20,63,"""What do you see?"""
345,20,64,"""I can see nothing; it is all dark."""
345,20,65,"""What do you hear?"" I could detect the strain in the Professor's patient
voice."
345,20,66,"""The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can
hear them on the outside."""
345,20,67,"""Then you are on a ship?"" We all looked at each other, trying to glean
something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came
quick: -  -"
345,20,68,"""Oh, yes!"""
345,20,69,"""What else do you hear?"""
345,20,70,"""The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the
creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan
falls into the rachet."""
345,20,71,"""What are you doing?"""
345,20,72,"""I am still -  - oh, so still. It is like death!"" The voice faded away into
a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again."
345,20,73,"By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of
day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid her
head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few
moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see
us all around her. ""Have I been talking in my sleep?"" was all she said.
She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she
was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the
conversation, and she said: -  -"
345,20,74,"""Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!"" Mr.
Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's calm
voice called them back: -  -"
345,20,75,"""Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor
whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in
your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be
thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we
know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,
since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking
forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but
that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the
Count's mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce
knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear
me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth - box left, and a pack of men
following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He
have take his last earth - box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He
think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would
say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and
we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a
little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters
between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he
would -  - unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or
slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to
us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with
us."" Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked: -  -"
345,20,76,"""But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?"" He
took her hand and patted it as he replied: -  -"
345,20,77,"""Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all
questions."" He would say no more, and we separated to dress."
345,20,78,"After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for
a minute and then said sorrowfully: -  -"
345,20,79,"""Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him
even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!"" She grew paler as
she asked faintly: -  -"
345,20,80,"""Why?"""
345,20,81,"""Because,"" he answered solemnly, ""he can live for centuries, and you are
but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded -  - since once he put that mark
upon your throat."""
345,20,82,I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.
345,21,0,"DR. SEWARD'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING"
345,21,1,This to Jonathan Harker.
345,21,2,"You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our
search -  - if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we
seek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to - day.
This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him
here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,
for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back
to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of
fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and
that last earth - box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the
money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun
go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that
he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.
But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last
resource -  - his last earth - work I might say did I wish _double entente_.
He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and
so he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,
and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;
when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will
comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope
when you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we
pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in
one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is
finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.
But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong
together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is
but begun, and in the end we shall win -  - so sure as that God sits on high
to watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return."
345,21,3,VAN HELSING.
345,21,4,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._
345,21,5,"_4 October._ -  - When I read to Mina, Van Helsing's message in the
phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the
certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;
and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible
danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to
believe in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem
like a long - forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
sunlight -  -  -  -"
345,21,6,"Alas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on
the red scar on my poor darling's white forehead. Whilst that lasts,
there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will
keep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been
over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality
seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is
something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.
Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may
be! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other
yet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and
the others after their investigations."
345,21,7,"The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run
for me again. It is now three o'clock."
345,21,8,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,21,9,"_5 October, 5 p. m._ -  - Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van
Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan
Harker, Mina Harker."
345,21,10,"Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to
discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape: -  -"
345,21,11,"""As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that
he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since
by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne
ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what
ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since
Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in
your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of
Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail,
however so small. There we find that only one Black - Sea - bound ship go
out with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from
Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the
Danube. 'Soh!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.' So off
we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood
so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire
of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face
and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey
give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and
put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he
still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask
many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they
have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of
others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but
nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know."
345,21,12,"""They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five
o'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose
and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in
black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the
time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship
sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and
then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of
gang - plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when
told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he
agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse
and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself
driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it
take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to
captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like
it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he
can come and see where it shall be. But he say 'no'; that he come not
yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he
had better be quick -  - with blood -  - for that his ship will leave the
place -  - of blood -  - before the turn of the tide -  - with blood. Then the thin
man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he
will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,
polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he
will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the
sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell
him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen -  - with bloom upon them and also
with blood -  - in his ship -  - with blood on her also. And so, after asking
where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship
forms, he departed."
345,21,13,"""No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, for
they had something else to think of -  - well with blood again; for it soon
became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as
was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,
and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.
The captain swore polyglot -  - very polyglot -  - polyglot with bloom and
blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to
fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,
when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang - plank again and
asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied
that he wished that he and his box -  - old and with much bloom and
blood -  - were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down
with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile
on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.
Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and
all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was
of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears
exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of
picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up
and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any
of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship
went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the
river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea."
345,21,14,"""And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for
our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the
Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when
we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope
is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then
he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There
are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about
where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us
invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in
Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present
his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.
When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and
have inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is not
for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own
way."""
345,21,15,"When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain
that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: ""We have the
best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this
morning."" I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should
pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that
he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,
at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more
forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some
of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst
men: -  -"
345,21,16,"""Yes, it is necessary -  - necessary -  - necessary! For your sake in the first,
and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm
already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short
time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in
darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my
dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or
in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his
own barren land -  - barren of peoples -  - and coming to a new land where life
of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the
work of centuries. Were another of the Un - Dead, like him, to try to do
what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have
been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of
nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in
some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un - Dead for
all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical
world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.
There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters
of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,
there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of
occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in
himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike
time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,
more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in
strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and
thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which
is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,
and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have
infect you -  - oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for
good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do
no more, you have only to live -  - to live in your own old, sweet way; and
so in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction,
shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together
that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that the
world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,
whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one
soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem
more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if
we fall, we fall in good cause."" He paused and I said: -  -"
345,21,17,"""But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven
from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from
which he has been hunted?"""
345,21,18,"""Aha!"" he said, ""your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall
adopt him. Your man - eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once
tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl
unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a
tiger, too, a man - eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he
is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go
over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be
beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.
Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child - brain that was to
him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What
does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for
him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He
find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He
study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old
ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new
land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that
he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help
him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at
the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a
ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater
world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know
him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole
peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,
what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we
are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our
efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not
even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest
strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons
to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls
for the safety of one we love -  - for the good of mankind, and for the
honour and glory of God."""
345,21,19,"After a general discussion it was determined that for to - night nothing
be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to
think out the proper conclusions. To - morrow, at breakfast, we are to
meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we
shall decide on some definite cause of action."
345,21,20,*       *       *       *       *
345,21,21,"I feel a wonderful peace and rest to - night. It is as if some haunting
presence were removed from me. Perhaps ..."
345,21,22,"My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the
mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still
unclean."
345,21,23,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,21,24,"_5 October._ -  - We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for
each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more
general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience
again."
345,21,25,"It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let
any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way -  - even by
death -  - and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More
than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether
the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I
caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was
brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the
matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our
trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her
trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something
recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to
meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of
action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct
rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear
that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied. I _know_
that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can
guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or
cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and
he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of
that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The
Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called ""the
Vampire's baptism of blood."" Well, there may be a poison that distils
itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is
a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my
instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a
terrible difficulty -  - an unknown danger -  - in the work before us. The same
power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think
further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!"
345,21,26,"Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall
try to open the subject with him."
345,21,27,*       *       *       *       *
345,21,28,"_Later._ -  - When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of
things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to
say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating
about the bush a little, he said suddenly: -  -"
345,21,29,"""Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just
at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our
confidence""; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on: -  -"
345,21,30,"""Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing."" A cold shiver ran
through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing
continued: -  -"
345,21,31,"""With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned
before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than
ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I
can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now
but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice
without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes
are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now
often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she
wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If
it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and
hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who
have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he
will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?"" I nodded
acquiescence; he went on: -  -"
345,21,32,"""Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of
our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful
task! Oh, so painful that it heart - break me to think of; but it must be.
When to - day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not
to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by
us."" He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration
at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor
soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort
to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at
any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the
effect was as I expected."
345,21,33,"It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has
gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I
really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone."
345,21,34,*       *       *       *       *
345,21,35,"_Later._ -  - At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was
experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a
message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as
she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements
without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each
other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own
part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was
much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we
agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to
preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to
confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van
Helsing roughly put the facts before us first: -  -"
345,21,36,"""The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take
her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to
reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.
Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such
weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if
we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite
safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate
be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such
preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed -  - armed
against evil things, spiritual as well as physical."" Here Quincey Morris
added: -  -"
345,21,37,"""I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be
that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to
our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any
trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack
after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater
apiece!"""
345,21,38,"""Good!"" said Van Helsing, ""Winchesters it shall be. Quincey's head is
level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more
dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we
can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of
us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.
To - night and to - morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we
four can set out on our journey."""
345,21,39,"""We four?"" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of
us."
345,21,40,"""Of course!"" answered the Professor quickly, ""you must remain to take
care of your so sweet wife!"" Harker was silent for awhile and then said
in a hollow voice: -  -"
345,21,41,"""Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with
Mina."" I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not
to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him
significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and
turned away."
345,21,42,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._
345,21,43,"_5 October, afternoon._ -  - For some time after our meeting this morning I
could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of
wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina's determination not
to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not
argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from
a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the
last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no
more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly
and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams
with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her."
345,21,44,*       *       *       *       *
345,21,45,"_Later._ -  - How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina's happy sleep, and
came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the
evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking
lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at
once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said: -  -"
345,21,46,"""Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A
promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be
broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter
tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once."""
345,21,47,"""Mina,"" I said, ""a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have
no right to make it."""
345,21,48,"""But, dear one,"" she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes
were like pole stars, ""it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.
You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may
do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved
from the promise."""
345,21,49,"""I promise!"" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though
to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.
She said: -  -"
345,21,50,"""Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for
the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or
implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!"" and she
solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said
solemnly: -  -"
345,21,51,"""I promise!"" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had
been shut between us."
345,21,52,*       *       *       *       *
345,21,53,"_Later, midnight._ -  - Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.
So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected
somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall
of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired
early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing
that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible
trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.
Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to - night. I shall
try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep."
345,21,54,*       *       *       *       *
345,21,55,"_6 October, morning._ -  - Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the
same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought
that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went
for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found
him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the
opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the
room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too."
345,21,56,"""No,"" she said quite simply, ""it will not be necessary. You can tell
them just as well. I must go with you on your journey."""
345,21,57,"Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment's pause he
asked: -  -"
345,21,58,"""But why?"""
345,21,59,"""You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,
too."""
345,21,60,"""But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest
duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than
any of us from -  - from circumstances -  - things that have been."" He paused,
embarrassed."
345,21,61,"As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead: -  -"
345,21,62,"""I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is
coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me
I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by
wile; by any device to hoodwink -  - even Jonathan."" God saw the look that
she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel
that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her
hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of
tears. She went on: -  -"
345,21,63,"""You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you
can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had
to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me
and so learn that which even I myself do not know."" Dr. Van Helsing said
very gravely: -  -"
345,21,64,"""Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and
together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve."" When he had
spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen
back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up
the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing
motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within
a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.
He told them what Mina had said, and went on: -  -"
345,21,65,"""In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a
new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony
to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are
warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be
ready to act the instant when that ship arrives."""
345,21,66,"""What shall we do exactly?"" asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor
paused before replying: -  -"
345,21,67,"""We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified
the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall
fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the
superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was
man's faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,
when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we
shall open the box, and -  - and all will be well."""
345,21,68,"""I shall not wait for any opportunity,"" said Morris. ""When I see the box
I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand
men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!"" I
grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.
I think he understood my look; I hope he did."
345,21,69,"""Good boy,"" said Dr. Van Helsing. ""Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God
bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or
pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do -  - what we must do. But,
indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things
which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that
until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and
when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now
let us to - day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch
on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us
can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own
affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make
arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for
our journey."""
345,21,70,"There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle
up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come...."
345,21,71,*       *       *       *       *
345,21,72,"_Later._ -  - It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she
survive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who
have been so good to us shall have remainder."
345,21,73,"It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina's uneasiness calls my
attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the
time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing
times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new
danger -  - some new pain, which, however, may in God's will be means to a
good end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must
not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they
shall be ready."
345,21,74,She is calling to me.
345,22,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
345,22,1,"_11 October, Evening._ -  - Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he
says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept."
345,22,2,"I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.
Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to
understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;
when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing
or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition
begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts
till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with
the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of
negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute
freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the
change - back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of
warning silence."
345,22,3,"To - night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the
signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a
violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few
minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning
her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,
she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband's hand
in hers began: -  -"
345,22,4,"""We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,
dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end."" This was to
her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. ""In
the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in
store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me
with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak
woman, whose soul perhaps is lost -  - no, no, not yet, but is at any rate
at stake -  - you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.
There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which
must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you
know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there
is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!"" She looked
appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband."
345,22,5,"""What is that way?"" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. ""What is that
way, which we must not -  - may not -  - take?"""
345,22,6,"""That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before
the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I
once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you
did my poor Lucy's. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing
that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the
friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die
in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be
done, is God's will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the
certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the
blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!"" We were all
silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The
faces of the others were set and Harker's grew ashen grey; perhaps he
guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued: -  -"
345,22,7,"""This is what I can give into the hotch - pot."" I could not but note the
quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all
seriousness. ""What will each of you give? Your lives I know,"" she went
on quickly, ""that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God's, and you
can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?"" She looked
again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband's face. Quincey
seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. ""Then I shall tell
you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this
connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all -  - even you,
my beloved husband -  - that, should the time come, you will kill me."""
345,22,8,"""What is that time?"" The voice was Quincey's, but it was low and
strained."
345,22,9,"""When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that
I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,
without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;
or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!"""
345,22,10,"Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her
and taking her hand in his said solemnly: -  -"
345,22,11,"""I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man should to
win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and
dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty
that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all
certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has
come!"""
345,22,12,"""My true friend!"" was all she could say amid her fast - falling tears, as,
bending over, she kissed his hand."
345,22,13,"""I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!"" said Van Helsing."
345,22,14,"""And I!"" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to
take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her
wan - eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of
his hair, and asked: -  -"
345,22,15,"""And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?"""
345,22,16,"""You too, my dearest,"" she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her
voice and eyes. ""You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and
all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all
time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed
their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the
hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because
those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men's duty
towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my
dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at
the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not
forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to him who loved"" -  - she stopped
with a flying blush, and changed her phrase -  - ""to him who had best right
to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make
it a happy memory of my husband's life that it was his loving hand which
set me free from the awful thrall upon me."""
345,22,17,"""Again I swear!"" came the Professor's resonant voice. Mrs. Harker
smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and
said: -  -"
345,22,18,"""And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:
this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in
such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a
time I myself might be -  - nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_ -  - leagued
with your enemy against you."""
345,22,19,"""One more request;"" she became very solemn as she said this, ""it is not
vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for
me, if you will."" We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need
to speak: -  -"
345,22,20,"""I want you to read the Burial Service."" She was interrupted by a deep
groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her
heart, and continued: ""You must read it over me some day. Whatever may
be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet
thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for
then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever -  - come what may!"""
345,22,21,"""But oh, my dear one,"" he pleaded, ""death is afar off from you."""
345,22,22,"""Nay,"" she said, holding up a warning hand. ""I am deeper in death at
this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!"""
345,22,23,"""Oh, my wife, must I read it?"" he said, before he began."
345,22,24,"""It would comfort me, my husband!"" was all she said; and he began to
read when she had got the book ready."
345,22,25,"""How can I -  - how could any one -  - tell of that strange scene, its
solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its
sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter
truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart
had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling
round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of
her husband's voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he
had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial
of the Dead. I -  - I cannot go on -  - words -  - and -  - v - voice -  - f - fail m - me!"""
345,22,26,*       *       *       *       *
345,22,27,"She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may
hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it
comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's coming
relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any
of us as we had dreaded."
345,22,28,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._
345,22,29,"_15 October, Varna._ -  - We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,
got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the
Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five
o'clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had
arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel -  - ""the
Odessus."" The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager
to get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into
port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.
Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is
coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept
nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very
wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to
hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he
had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by
habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at
these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He
always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first: -  -"
345,22,30,"""Nothing; all is dark."" And to the second: -  -"
345,22,31,"""I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing
by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is
high -  - I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.""
It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on
her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four
telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:
that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd's from
anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should
send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He
was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be
sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire."
345,22,32,"We had dinner and went to bed early. To - morrow we are to see the
Vice - Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship
as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get
on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the
form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man's form without
suspicion -  - which he evidently wishes to avoid -  - he must remain in the
box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;
for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,
before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for
much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the
seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,
and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the
ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being
warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I
think!"
345,22,33,*       *       *       *       *
345,22,34,"_16 October._ -  - Mina's report still the same: lapping waves and rushing
water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and
when we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she must
pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report."
345,22,35,*       *       *       *       *
345,22,36,"_17 October._ -  - Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome
the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that
he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own
risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every
facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a
similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who
was much impressed with Godalming's kindly manner to him, and we are all
satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We
have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the
Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and
drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall
prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall
have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body,
it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no
evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But
even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps
some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and
a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it
were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our
intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the
_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special
messenger."
345,22,37,*       *       *       *       *
345,22,38,"_24 October._ -  - A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,
but only the same story: ""Not yet reported."" Mina's morning and evening
hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking
masts."
345,22,39,"_Telegram, October 24th._"
345,22,40,"_Rufus Smith, Lloyd's, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.
Vice - Consul, Varna._"
345,22,41,"""_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles."""
345,22,42,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,22,43,"_25 October._ -  - How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is
irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with
excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd's. I
know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.
Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After
all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to
let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any
excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am
sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but
in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The
lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is
getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We
talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It
would break poor Harker's heart -  - certainly his nerve -  - if he knew that we
had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,
her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for
he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active
danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be
necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to
be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should
neither of us shrink from the task -  - awful though it be to contemplate.
""Euthanasia"" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to
whoever invented it."
345,22,44,"It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the
rate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should therefore
arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in
before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one
o'clock, so as to be ready."
345,22,45,*       *       *       *       *
345,22,46,"_25 October, Noon_. -  - No news yet of the ship's arrival. Mrs. Harker's
hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible
that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of
excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and
an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife
which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the
Count if the edge of that ""Kukri"" ever touches his throat, driven by
that stern, ice - cold hand!"
345,22,47,"Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to - day. About
noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we
kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She
had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know
that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually
that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to
her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so
well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than
anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder
that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good."
345,22,48,*       *       *       *       *
345,22,49,"_Later._ -  - Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep
of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had
been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he
may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To
his doom, I trust!"
345,22,50,*       *       *       *       *
345,22,51,"_26 October._ -  - Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.
She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is
apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was still the
same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;
some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as
the ship may now be signalled any moment."
345,22,52,*       *       *       *       *
345,22,53,"_27 October, Noon._ -  - Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.
Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: ""lapping
waves and rushing water,"" though she added that ""the waves were very
faint."" The telegrams from London have been the same: ""no further
report."" Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he
fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly: -  -"
345,22,54,"""I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina's. Souls and memories can do
strange things during trance."" I was about to ask him more, but Harker
just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to - night
at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state."
345,22,55,*       *       *       *       *
345,22,56,"_28 October._ -  - Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,
care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._"
345,22,57,"""_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o'clock
to - day."""
345,22,58,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,22,59,"_28 October._ -  - When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I
do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been
expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would
come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.
The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things
would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the
change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose
that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against
ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know
that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if
it be a will - o' - the - wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all
took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a
moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a
word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord
Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half
stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris
tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our
old wandering days it meant ""action."" Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so
that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands
meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled -  - actually smiled -  - the
dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his
action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of
the great Kukri knife and rested there. ""When does the next train start
for Galatz?"" said Van Helsing to us generally."
345,22,60,"""At 6:30 to - morrow morning!"" We all started, for the answer came from
Mrs. Harker."
345,22,61,"""How on earth do you know?"" said Art."
345,22,62,"""You forget -  - or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so
does Dr. Van Helsing -  - that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I
always used to make up the time - tables, so as to be helpful to my
husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of
the time - tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle
Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I
learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,
as the only train to - morrow leaves as I say."""
345,22,63,"""Wonderful woman!"" murmured the Professor."
345,22,64,"""Can't we get a special?"" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his
head: ""I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even
if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our
regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.
Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the
tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do
you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him
letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship
just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice - Consul, and get
his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way
smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay
with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you
may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here
with Madam to make report."""
345,22,65,"""And I,"" said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she
had been for many a long day, ""shall try to be of use in all ways, and
shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting
from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!""
The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to
realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to
each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the
time, however."
345,22,66,"When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.
Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of
Harker's journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door
was shut upon her he said to me: -  -"
345,22,67,"""We mean the same! speak out!"""
345,22,68,"""There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may
deceive us."""
345,22,69,"""Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?"""
345,22,70,"""No!"" said I, ""unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone."""
345,22,71,"""You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell
you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great -  - a terrible -  - risk;
but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those
words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In
the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her
mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth - box in the ship
with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn
then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with
eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin - box.
Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not."
345,22,72,"""He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;
but he cut her off -  - take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that
so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man - brains that
have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will
come higher than his child - brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,
that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and
therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!
She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when
we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great
brain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have
a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away
altogether -  - though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall
learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never
feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!"""
345,22,73,"I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled
himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into
the room, bright and happy - looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly
forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets
of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face
brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and
thumb he said: -  -"
345,22,74,"""Friend John, to you with so much of experience already -  - and you, too,
dear Madam Mina, that are young -  - here is a lesson: do not fear ever to
think. A half - thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to
let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to
where that half - thought come from and I find that he be no half - thought
at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet
strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the ""Ugly Duck"" of my friend
Hans Andersen, he be no duck - thought at all, but a big swan - thought that
sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I
read here what Jonathan have written: -  -"
345,22,75,"""That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought
his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was
beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come
alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph."""
345,22,76,"""What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count's child - thought see
nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man - thought see nothing; my
man - thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word
from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what
it mean -  - what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,
yet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch -  - then
pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill
and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and
leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever
study the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No.' You, John, yes; for it is
a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not -  - not
but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad
universale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,
in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much
from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to
be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime -  - that is the true
criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.
This criminal has not full man - brain. He is clever and cunning and
resourceful; but he be not of man - stature as to brain. He be of
child - brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime
also; he, too, have child - brain, and it is of the child to do what he
have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not
by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to
him the ground to start from to do more. '_Dos pou sto_,' said
Archimedes. 'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!' To do once,
is the fulcrum whereby child - brain become man - brain; and until he have
the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,
just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are
opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,"" for
Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on: -  -"
345,22,77,"""Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with
those so bright eyes."" He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.
His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and
unconsciously, as she spoke: -  -"
345,22,78,"""The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would
so classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.
Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a
clue, and the one page of it that we know -  - and that from his own
lips -  - tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a
'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had
tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself
for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.
So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all
hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over
the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube
from Turkey Land."""
345,22,79,"""Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!"" said Van Helsing,
enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he
said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick - room
consultation: -  -"
345,22,80,"""Seventy - two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope."" Turning to
her again, he said with keen expectation: -  -"
345,22,81,"""But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;
John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.
Speak, without fear!"""
345,22,82,"""I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical."""
345,22,83,"""Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think."""
345,22,84,"""Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small
and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one
purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,
leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being
safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat
from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful
night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul
is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me
is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for
his ends."" The Professor stood up: -  -"
345,22,85,"""He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,
whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to
Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.
But his child - mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in
God's Providence, the very thing that the evil - doer most reckoned on for
his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken
in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he
is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so
many hours to him, then his selfish child - brain will whisper him to
sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,
there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That
terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him
in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the
sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;
and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your
suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know
it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his
knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe
that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark
hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril
ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great
hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe
and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work
you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do."""
345,22,86,"And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker
has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us."
345,23,0,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
345,23,1,"_29 October._ -  - This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last
night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us
had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,
and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and
for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.
Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and
more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually
necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but
this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty
resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came: -  -"
345,23,2,"""I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a
steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear
men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in
the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.
There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged
along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air
blowing upon me."""
345,23,3,"Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay
on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a
weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.
Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst
Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There
was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was
passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she
sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly: -  -"
345,23,4,"""Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!"" We
could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get
tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said: -  -"
345,23,5,"""You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his
earth - chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie
hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do
not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be
in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did
at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he
be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men
may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on
shore to - night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.
We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come
on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his
true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered."""
345,23,6,"There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;
at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker."
345,23,7,"Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her
response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming
than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was
so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole
soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made
reply: -  -"
345,23,8,"""All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as
of wood on wood."" She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till
to - night."
345,23,9,"And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of
expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;
but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot
possibly get in till well after sun - up. Thus we shall have two more
hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw
more light on what is happening."
345,23,10,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,11,"_Later._ -  - Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when
there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a
station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than
this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's
sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that
her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance
hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes
on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count's power
over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be
a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did
speak, her words were enigmatical: -  -"
345,23,12,"""Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can
hear, far off, confused sounds -  - as of men talking in strange tongues,
fierce - falling water, and the howling of wolves."" She stopped and a
shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,
till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even
in answer to the Professor's imperative questioning. When she woke from
the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was
all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;
when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in
silence."
345,23,13,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,14,"_30 October, 7 a. m._ -  - We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time
to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no
effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still
greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor
lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness: -  -"
345,23,15,"""All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the
creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a
queer one like -  -  -  - "" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still."
345,23,16,"""Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!"" said Van Helsing in an agonised
voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun
was reddening even Mrs. Harker's pale face. She opened her eyes, and we
all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost
unconcern: -  -"
345,23,17,"""Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't? I don't remember
anything."" Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,
turning from one to the other with a troubled look: -  -"
345,23,18,"""What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was
lying here, half asleep, and heard you say go on! speak, I command you!'
It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad
child!"""
345,23,19,"""Oh, Madam Mina,"" he said, sadly, ""it is proof, if proof be needed, of
how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more
earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I
am proud to obey!"""
345,23,20,"The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with
anxiety and eagerness."
345,23,21,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,23,22,"_30 October._ -  - Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been
ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since
he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed
much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the
Vice - Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two
doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival
of the _Czarina Catherine_."
345,23,23,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,24,"_Later._ -  - Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the
Vice - Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.
He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power."
345,23,25,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._
345,23,26,"_30 October._ -  - At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called
on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of
Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord
Godalming's telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in
their power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once
on board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river
harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his
voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a
run."
345,23,27,"""Man!"" he said, ""but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should
have to pay for it wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up the
average. It's no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi' a wind
ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail for his
ain purpose. An' a' the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh
a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi' us,
till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could
we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi'oot bein' able to signal; an' till we
came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we
never were within hail o' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail
and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the
Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it
whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our
miscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an' the Old Mon who
had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no
hinderin' him."" This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said: -  -"
345,23,28,"""Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and
he know when he meet his match!"" The skipper was not displeased with the
compliment, and went on: -  -"
345,23,29,"""When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them,
the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had
been put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had started
frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the
supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot
their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I
felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was
agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up for
five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get
somewheres -  - well, he would fetch it up a'reet. An' if he didn't, well,
we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and
deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin' sun came
through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.
The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the
box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi' them aboot it wi' a
handspike; an' when the last o' them rose off the deck wi' his head in
his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the
property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the
river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I'd let it
lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. We
didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor;
but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun - up, a man came
aboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box
marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to
his hand. He had his papers a' reet, an' glad I was to be rid o' the
dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil
did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' it was nane ither
than that same!"""
345,23,30,"""What was the name of the man who took it?"" asked Dr. Van Helsing with
restrained eagerness."
345,23,31,"""I'll be tellin' ye quick!"" he answered, and, stepping down to his
cabin, produced a receipt signed ""Immanuel Hildesheim."" Burgen - strasse
16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so
with thanks we came away."
345,23,32,"We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi
Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were
pointed with specie -  - we doing the punctuation -  - and with a little
bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but
important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling
him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box
which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to
give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks
who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by
an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube
International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to
the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all
he knew."
345,23,33,"We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his
neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had
gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by
his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house
together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten
and eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again."
345,23,34,"Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that
the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of
St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild
animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the
women crying out ""This is the work of a Slovak!"" We hurried away lest we
should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained."
345,23,35,"As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all
convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where
that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home
to the hotel to Mina."
345,23,36,"When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina
again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at
least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was
released from my promise to her."
345,23,37,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,23,38,"_30 October, evening._ -  - They were so tired and worn out and dispirited
that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked
them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything
up to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the
""Traveller's"" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for
me. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write
with a pen...."
345,23,39,"It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,
what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to
breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his
face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can
see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh!
if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can."
345,23,40,"I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I
have not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all
carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to
follow the Professor's example, and think without prejudice on the facts
before me...."
345,23,41,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,42,"I do believe that under God's providence I have made a discovery. I
shall get the maps and look over them...."
345,23,43,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,44,"I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, so
I shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it is
well to be accurate, and every minute is precious."
345,23,45,_Mina Harker's Memorandum._
345,23,46,(Entered in her Journal.)
345,23,47,"_Ground of inquiry._ -  - Count Dracula's problem is to get back to his own
place."
345,23,48,"(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he
power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,
or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or
interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be -  - confined
as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box."
345,23,49,"(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_ -  - Here a process of exclusions may help
us. By road, by rail, by water?"
345,23,50,"1. _By Road._ -  - There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the
city."
345,23,51,"(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,
a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him."
345,23,52,"(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass."
345,23,53,"(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order
to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even
his victim -  - me!"
345,23,54,"2. _By Rail._ -  - There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to
take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies
on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if
left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not
what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it."
345,23,55,"3. _By Water._ -  - Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even
then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were
he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would
indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were
unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would
still be desperate."
345,23,56,"We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do
is to ascertain _what_ water."
345,23,57,"The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,
then, get a light on what his later task is to be."
345,23,58,"_Firstly._ -  - We must differentiate between what he did in London as part
of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had
to arrange as best he could."
345,23,59,"_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we
know of, what he has done here."
345,23,60,"As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent
invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel
Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is
also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but
there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to
Hildesheim."
345,23,61,"That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_
made a phenomenally quick journey -  - so much so that Captain Donelson's
suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness
played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind
through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the
Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared
the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it -  - and here
we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,
moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been
avoided."
345,23,62,"Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival -  - _on
land_, at Galatz."
345,23,63,"The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could
appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to
aid in the work? In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing
with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's
remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general
feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation."
345,23,64,"My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his
castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from
the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks
who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.
Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this
service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he
came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to
arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and
he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,
by murdering his agent."
345,23,65,"I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the
Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in
the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling
level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,
was on a river in an open boat -  - propelled probably either by oars or
poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There
would be no such sound if floating down stream."
345,23,66,"Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may
possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more
easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza
which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as
close to Dracula's castle as can be got by water."
345,23,67,_Mina Harker's Journal -  - continued._
345,23,68,"When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The
others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said: -  -"
345,23,69,"""Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where
we were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we
may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on
him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he
is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry
him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw
him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,
to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all
shall do."""
345,23,70,"""I shall get a steam launch and follow him,"" said Lord Godalming."
345,23,71,"""And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,"" said Mr.
Morris."
345,23,72,"""Good!"" said the Professor, ""both good. But neither must go alone. There
must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and
rough, and he carries rude arms."" All the men smiled, for amongst them
they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris: -  -"
345,23,73,"""I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and
there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other
precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could
not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points."" Dr.
Seward said: -  -"
345,23,74,"""I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt
together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come
along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the
Slovaks, and a chance thrust -  - for I don't suppose these fellows carry
guns -  - would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we
shall not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and
we are sure that he cannot re - incarnate."" He looked at Jonathan as he
spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was
torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the
boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...
the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was
silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke: -  -"
345,23,75,"""Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you
are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the
last; and again that it is your right to destroy him -  - that -  - which has
wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she
will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as
once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to
fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in
other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let
me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and
friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and
whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be
landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's
country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running
stream whence he cannot escape to land -  - where he dares not raise the lid
of his coffin - box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
perish -  - we shall go in the track where Jonathan went, -  - from Bistritz
over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam
Mina's hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way -  - all
dark and unknown otherwise -  - after the first sunrise when we are near
that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be
made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated."" Here
Jonathan interrupted him hotly: -  -"
345,23,76,"""Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,
in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, right
into the jaws of his death - trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or
Hell!"" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on: -  -"
345,23,77,"""Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish
infamy -  - with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every
speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?
Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?"" Here he turned to
me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:
""Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!"" and he sank
down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor's voice, as he
spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed
us all: -  -"
345,23,78,"""Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful
place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that
place. There is work -  - wild work -  - to be done there, that her eyes may not
see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what
is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in
terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time -  - and he is strong and
subtle and cunning -  - he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then
in time our dear one"" -  - he took my hand -  - ""would come to him to keep him
company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have
told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they
clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and
well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is
necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,
possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,
it is I who would have to go to keep them company."""
345,23,79,"""Do as you will,"" said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, ""we
are in the hands of God!"""
345,23,80,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,81,"_Later._ -  - Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.
How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and
so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!
What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do
when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and
that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing
to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could
not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within
another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each
of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam
launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice. Dr. Seward
and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have
all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor
Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to - night for Veresti,
where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are
bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and
horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust
in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,
so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a
large - bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like
the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my
forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me
that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting
colder every hour, and there are snow - flurries which come and go as
warnings."
345,23,82,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,83,"_Later._ -  - It took all my courage to say good - bye to my darling. We may
never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;
his look is a warning. There must be no tears now -  - unless it may be that
God will let them fall in gladness."
345,23,84,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._
345,23,85,"_October 30. Night._ -  - I am writing this in the light from the furnace
door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an
experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his
own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our
plans, we finally decided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if any
waterway was chosen for the Count's escape back to his Castle, the
Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took
it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the
place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the
Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at
night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to
make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to
sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on
watch. But I cannot sleep -  - how can I with the terrible danger hanging
over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only
comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would
be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.
Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;
they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher
lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following
of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead
their spare horses -  - four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When
they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look
after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they
can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and
can be easily adapted for Mina, if required."
345,23,86,"It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through
the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike
us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes
home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into
a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the
furnace door...."
345,23,87,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,88,"_31 October._ -  - Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is
sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat
is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only
a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of
anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every
time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
prayed."
345,23,89,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,90,"_1 November, evening._ -  - No news all day; we have found nothing of the
kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong
in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over - hauled every boat, big
and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,
and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,
so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a
Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we
have over - hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every
deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose
to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,
going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This
was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the
boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu
we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the
night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell
upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he
shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor
dear Mina and me."
345,23,91,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,92,"_2 November, morning._ -  - It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not
wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and
was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept
so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new
man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do
all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and
keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to
me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to
Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the
carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they
would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am
afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we
cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how
Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless
streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
are very large -  - at present, at all events, though they are terrible
doubtless in winter and when the snow melts -  - the horsemen may not have
met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see
them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be
necessary to take counsel together what to do next."
345,23,93,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,23,94,"_2 November._ -  - Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it
if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the
rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.
Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;
we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again."
345,23,95,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,96,"_3 November._ -  - We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the
Bistritza. I wish it wasn't so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and
if it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and
go on, Russian fashion."
345,23,97,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,98,"_4 November._ -  - To - day we heard of the launch having been detained by an
accident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get
up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up
only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and
evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got
up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase
afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the
peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept
stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push
on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon."
345,23,99,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,23,100,"_31 October._ -  - Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that
this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I
could say was: ""dark and quiet."" He is off now buying a carriage and
horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so
that we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more
than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if
only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to
see it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a
pleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of
their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and
picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint
people! But, alas! -  -"
345,23,101,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,102,"_Later._ -  - Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and
horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The
landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough
for a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to
me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has
been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats
and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of
our being cold."
345,23,103,*       *       *       *       *
345,23,104,"We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are
truly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him,
with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over
my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I
loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and
truest thought will be always for him."
345,24,0,MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL
345,24,1,"_1 November._ -  - All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The
horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go
willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many
changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to
think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;
he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well
to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and
off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable
kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full
of nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first
house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my
forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to
keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an
extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Ever
since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no
driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay
that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The
Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he
made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he
says that I answered as usual ""darkness, lapping water and creaking
wood""; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of
Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write
this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.
Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and
grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleep
he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make
him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,
and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be
needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly."
345,24,2,*       *       *       *       *
345,24,3,"_2 November, morning._ -  - I was successful, and we took turns driving all
night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange
heaviness in the air -  - I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean
that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep
us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered
""darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,"" so the river is changing as
they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of
danger -  - more than need be; but we are in God's hands."
345,24,4,*       *       *       *       *
345,24,5,"_2 November, night._ -  - All day long driving. The country gets wilder as
we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed
so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us
and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an
effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.
Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The
houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse
we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He
got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude
four - in - hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no
trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can
drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive
before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what
will to - morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor
darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and
that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,
and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His
sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign
to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred
His wrath."
345,24,6,_Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._
345,24,7,"_4 November._ -  - This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of
Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is
morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept
alive -  - Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey
heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all
winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have
affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was
not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual
so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost
her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so
faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.
However, to - night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh
and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset
I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown
less and less with each day, and to - night it fail me altogether. Well,
God's will be done -  - whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!"
345,24,8,"Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I
must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go
unrecorded."
345,24,9,"We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I
saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our
carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a
couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but
more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As
before, came the answer: ""darkness and the swirling of water."" Then she
woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.
At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new
guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say: -  -"
345,24,10,"""This is the way."""
345,24,11,"""How know you it?"" I ask."
345,24,12,"""Of course I know it,"" she answer, and with a pause, add: ""Have not my
Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?"""
345,24,13,"At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one
such by - road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach
road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and
more of use."
345,24,14,"So we came down this road; when we meet other ways -  - not always were we
sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow
have fallen -  - the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and
they go on so patient. By - and - by we find all the things which Jonathan
have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long
hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and
she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to
suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may
not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm
her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be
all - in - all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel
guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the
reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I
look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset
time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,
so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though
it were the end of the world."
345,24,15,"Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and
then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as
though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and
myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,
and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we
first enter the Count's house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she
is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I
light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she
prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,
to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go
to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already -  - that
she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have
grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She
help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the
fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all
of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying
quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice
more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I
wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes
obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then
sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have
to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have
harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look
in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it
not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid! -  - I am afraid of all things -  - even
to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and
death, or more than these, and we must not flinch."
345,24,16,*       *       *       *       *
345,24,17,"_5 November, morning._ -  - Let me be accurate in everything, for though you
and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think
that I, Van Helsing, am mad -  - that the many horrors and the so long
strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain."
345,24,18,"All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,
frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held
sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I
did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her -  - even for food. I
began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as
she is with that Vampire baptism. ""Well,"" said I to myself, ""if it be
that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at
night."" As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and
imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked
with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still
sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning
mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a
steep - rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell
of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,
the end was near."
345,24,19,"I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!
unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us -  - for
even after down - sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and
all was for a time in a great twilight -  - I took out the horses and fed
them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make
Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid
her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that
she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But
I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the
fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round
where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and
I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the
time -  - so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the
snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she
clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to
feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when
she had grown more quiet: -  -"
345,24,20,"""Will you not come over to the fire?"" for I wished to make a test of
what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she
stopped, and stood as one stricken."
345,24,21,"""Why not go on?"" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat
down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked
from sleep, she said simply: -  -"
345,24,22,"""I cannot!"" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she
could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be
danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!"
345,24,23,"Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I
came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they
whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a
time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to
the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was
with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was
about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying
sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of
some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the
snow - flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with
trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses
whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to
fear -  - horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that
ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of
the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and
all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's
horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist
began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy
glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses
cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even
the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I
feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and
circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when
I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held
me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low
it was: -  -"
345,24,24,"""No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!"" I turned to her, and
looking in her eyes, said: -  -"
345,24,25,"""But you? It is for you that I fear!"" whereat she laughed -  - a laugh, low
and unreal, and said: -  -"
345,24,26,"""Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them
than I am,"" and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of
wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.
Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the
wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without
the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till -  - if God have not
take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes -  - there were before me
in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when
they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the
bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous
lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came
through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to
her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were
of the intolerable sweetness of the water - glasses: -  -"
345,24,27,"""Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!"" In fear I turned to my poor
Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the
terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my
heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I
seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the
Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and
laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for
I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not
approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within
the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The
horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on
them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor
beasts no more of terror."
345,24,28,"And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the
snow - gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but
when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.
At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the
whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
towards the castle, and were lost."
345,24,29,"Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending
to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I
could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made
no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have
made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To - day I have
much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there
may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist
obscure it, will be to me a safety."
345,24,30,"I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible
work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her
sleep...."
345,24,31,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._
345,24,32,"_4 November, evening._ -  - The accident to the launch has been a terrible
thing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;
and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,
off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we
follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We
have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only
Morris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more
Good - bye, Mina! God bless and keep you."
345,24,33,_Dr. Seward's Diary._
345,24,34,"_5 November._ -  - With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing
away from the river with their leiter - wagon. They surrounded it in a
cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly
and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own
feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of
wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are
dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,
and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,
or where, or what, or when, or how it may be...."
345,24,35,_Dr. Van Helsing's Memorandum._
345,24,36,"_5 November, afternoon._ -  - I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy
at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left
Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.
The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was
useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty
hinges, lest some ill - intent or ill - chance should close them, so that
being entered I might not get out. Jonathan's bitter experience served
me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I
knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if
there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either
there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.
Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.
The dilemma had me between his horns."
345,24,37,"Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the
Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I
resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must
submit, if it were God's will. At any rate it was only death and
freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the
choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than
the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work."
345,24,38,"I knew that there were at least three graves to find -  - graves that are
inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her
Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as
though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when
such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,
found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,
and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the
wanton Un - Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset
come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair
woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a
kiss -  - and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire
fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un - Dead!..."
345,24,39,"There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence
of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and
heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such
as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved -  - I, Van Helsing,
with all my purpose and with my motive for hate -  - I was moved to a
yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my
very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the
strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it
was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open - eyed sleep of one who yields
to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow - stilled air a
long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound
of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard."
345,24,40,"Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching
away tomb - tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not
pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should
begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in
a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister
which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of
the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so
exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls
some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl
with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul - wail of my dear Madam
Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought
further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had
searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as
there had been only three of these Un - Dead phantoms around us in the
night, I took it that there were no more of active Un - Dead existent.
There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and
nobly proportioned. On it was but one word"
345,24,41,DRACULA.
345,24,42,"This then was the Un - Dead home of the King - Vampire, to whom so many more
were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.
Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my
awful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished
him from it, Un - Dead, for ever."
345,24,43,"Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it
had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had
been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet
Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived
through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the
years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives...."
345,24,44,"Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by
thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of
fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though
till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen
the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just
ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been
won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have
endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of
writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and
left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them
now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death
for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife
severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and
crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come
centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud ""I
am here!"""
345,24,45,"Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can
the Count enter there Un - Dead."
345,24,46,"When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her
sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much."
345,24,47,"""Come!"" she said, ""come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my
husband who is, I know, coming towards us."" She was looking thin and
pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was
glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the
fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep."
345,24,48,"And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet
our friends -  - and _him_ -  - whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are
coming to meet us."
345,24,49,_Mina Harker's Journal._
345,24,50,"_6 November._ -  - It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I
took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did
not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take
heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being
left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our
provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we
could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of
habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy
walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the
clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under
the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the
Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,
perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with
seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain
on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We
could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the
sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was
full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about
that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less
exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we
could trace it through the drifted snow."
345,24,51,"In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined
him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,
with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the
hand and drew me in: ""See!"" he said, ""here you will be in shelter; and
if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one."" He brought in our
furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and
forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was
repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could
not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not
reproach me. Taking his field - glasses from the case, he stood on the top
of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out: -  -"
345,24,52,"""Look! Madam Mina, look! look!"" I sprang up and stood beside him on the
rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling
more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning
to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the
snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we
were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the
white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in
kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far
off -  - in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before -  - came a
group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a
long leiter - wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail
wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the
snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were
peasants or gypsies of some kind."
345,24,53,"On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I
felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and
well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned
there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all
pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,
however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round
the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last
night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying: -  -"
345,24,54,"""At least you shall be safe here from _him_!"" He took the glasses from
me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.
""See,"" he said, ""they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and
galloping as hard as they can."" He paused and went on in a hollow
voice: -  -"
345,24,55,"""They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be
done!"" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole
landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his
glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry: -  -"
345,24,56,"""Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the
south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow
blots it all out!"" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward
and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.
At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around
I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at
break - neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,
of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with
the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,
and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he
laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the
opening of our shelter. ""They are all converging,"" he said. ""When the
time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides."" I got out my revolver
ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came
louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.
It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,
and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down
towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could
see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger
numbers -  - the wolves were gathering for their prey."
345,24,57,"Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in
fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in
circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;
but at others, as the hollow - sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to
clear the air - space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of
late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew
with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the
sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less
than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various
bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer
and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly
had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,
the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each
party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did
not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they
seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower
and lower on the mountain tops."
345,24,58,"Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind
our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined
that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our
presence."
345,24,59,"All at once two voices shouted out to: ""Halt!"" One was my Jonathan's,
raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute
tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but
there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were
spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming
and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the
other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid - looking fellow who sat his
horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his
companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang
forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an
unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van
Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.
Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew
up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the
gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held
himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant."
345,24,60,"The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in
front, and pointing first to the sun -  - now close down on the hill
tops -  - and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.
For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses
and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing
Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been
upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,
surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our
parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly
formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one
shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the
order."
345,24,61,"In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring
of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was
evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun
should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the
levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor
the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their
attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his
purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they
cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the
cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great
box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.
Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of
Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,
with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had
seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and
they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first
I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang
beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that
with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was
spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for
as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,
attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked
the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the
lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and
the top of the box was thrown back."
345,24,62,"By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,
and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made
no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the
shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count
lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from
the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen
image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I
knew too well."
345,24,63,"As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them
turned to triumph."
345,24,64,"But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.
I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same
moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart."
345,24,65,"It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the
drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from
our sight."
345,24,66,"I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final
dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never
could have imagined might have rested there."
345,24,67,"The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone
of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the
setting sun."
345,24,68,"The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary
disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as
if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the
leiter - wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,
which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving
us alone."
345,24,69,"Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his
hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I
flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the
two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his
head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand
in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of
my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said: -  -"
345,24,70,"""I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!"" he cried
suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, ""It was
worth for this to die! Look! look!"""
345,24,71,"The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams
fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse
the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest ""Amen"" broke from all
as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man
spoke: -  -"
345,24,72,"""Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not
more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!"""
345,24,73,"And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a
gallant gentleman."
345,24,74,NOTE
345,24,75,"Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of
some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It
is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy's birthday is the same
day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the
secret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed into
him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but
we call him Quincey."
345,24,76,"In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went
over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and
terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things
which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were
